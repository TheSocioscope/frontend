    "icon": "🔬",
    "title": "The World's First Social Microscope",
    "description1": "Just as the microscope revolutionized biology by revealing the hidden world of cells, The Socioscope is revealing the hidden patterns of social transformation.",
    "description2": "We're building a systematic way to see what was previously invisible: how individual actions connect to form collective change."

  "vision": {
    "title": "Why This Matters",
    "statement": "We're facing existential challenges: climate collapse, inequality, democratic fragility. We need to understand how societies actually transform—not in theory, but in practice.",
    "details1": "The Socioscope doesn't just produce academic papers. It reveals what makes change work: which interventions succeed, which fail, and why. It shows policymakers what policies actually take root. It helps organizers understand what makes movements scale. It gives communities the knowledge to design their own pathways to transformation.",
    "details2": "This is about building a sustainable future that's not just environmentally sound, but socially resilient and economically just: while contributing to innovative methodologies for data collection, LLM-driven research, and the food system itself."
