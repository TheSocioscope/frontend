    "details1": "The Socioscope doesn't just produce academic papers. It reveals what makes change work: which interventions succeed, which fail, and why. It shows policymakers what policies actually take root. It helps organizers understand what makes movements scale. It gives communities the knowledge to design their own pathways to transformation.",
    "details2": "This is about building a sustainable future that's not just environmentally sound, but socially resilient and economically just: while contributing to innovative methodologies for data collection, LLM-driven research, and the food system itself."
