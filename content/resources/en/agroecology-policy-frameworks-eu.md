  The Food Socioscope project aims to understand the systemic transition towards
  greater

  sustainability in the food sector. It has two main components: a participatory data collection with a

  community directory, and a comprehensive research effort. The first component builds a community

  of practitioners from various sectors (e.g., companies, NGOs, public authorities) who manage

  initiatives promoting food sustainability. This community, facilitated by the Food Socioscope

  Netboard, fosters knowledge exchange by publishing key characteristics of these initiatives online.

  The second component collects qualitative data through in-depth field interviews, site visits and

  videos with practitioners, following a rigorously tested protocol. This in-depth data, capturing

  activities from micro to macro levels, feeds into the research project to improve understanding of

  systemic change in food sustainability. The research spans the entire food supply chain and examines the supporting infrastructure and organizational setups. By analysing 600 initiatives, worldwide,

  within their broader contexts, the project aims to identify mechanisms of transition, including

  barriers and success factors. To collect, process and analyse its vast amount of qualitative data, in

  multiple languages, the project uses novel protocols, AI models, network analysis, and other

  quantitative methods. This paper presents the project and preliminary findings regarding regulation,

  the asymmetry of social contracts and the practitioners' motivations.
