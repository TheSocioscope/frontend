title: "Why People Do What They Do: And How To Get Them To Change"
authors: Saadi Lahlou
category: book
date: "2024"
abstract: "Drawing on a large body of empirical research, Lahlou shows that
  people’s behaviour is predictable and shaped by ‘installations’ combining
  three sets of factors: what is technically possible (affordances of the
  environment), what people are able to do (embodied competences), and what
  monitors and controls behaviour (social regulation). "
