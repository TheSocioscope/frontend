question: What makes The Socioscope different from other research projects?
order: 4
---

The Socioscope is unique in several ways:

**Scale and Scope**: We're documenting over 1,000 initiatives across 30+ countries and 5 continents—creating an unprecedented comparative dataset.

**LLM-Driven Methodology**: We're establishing new research methods that can process qualitative data at scale while preserving contextual nuance and cultural specificity.

**Systems Approach**: We capture how change happens across economic, ecological, cultural, and governance dimensions simultaneously—not just in isolation.

**Actionable Insights**: We don't just produce academic papers. We reveal what makes change work, helping policymakers, organizers, and communities design effective interventions.

**Open Science**: We're committed to making our findings accessible to practitioners, policymakers, and communities—not just academics.
