question: How is the data collected?
order: 2

We use sophisticated in-person data collection across 29 countries, capturing not just what initiatives do, but how they transform economic, ecological, cultural, and governance systems.

Our researchers conduct:
- **Ethnographic fieldwork**: Deep observation and participation in community initiatives
- **Structured interviews**: Systematic conversations with key actors
- **Participatory observation**: Engaging directly with transformation processes
- **Document analysis**: Reviewing records, reports, and communications
- **Network mapping**: Understanding relationships and connections

This multi-method approach allows us to build the most comprehensive dataset of food system transformations in existence.
