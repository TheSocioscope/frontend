The Socioscope is a groundbreaking research initiative that documents and analyzes food system transformations worldwide. Just as the microscope revolutionized biology by revealing the hidden world of cells, The Socioscope reveals the hidden patterns of social transformation.

We're building a systematic way to understand how individual actions connect to form collective change, focusing on sustainable food systems as our "model organism" for studying societal transformation.
