We combine academic rigor with participatory research approaches through a four-step process: (1) Identification through network analysis and community nominations, (2) Documentation via in-depth interviews with initiative leaders, (3) Analysis using AI-powered mixed methods to identify patterns, and (4) Dissemination through publications, social media, and community engagement.
