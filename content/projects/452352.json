  "description": "The PRODA initiative, launched 25 years ago, aims to enhance food sovereignty through community-based vegetable gardens in Neuquén, Argentina. It began as a response to economic crises, evolving to support families in self-sufficiency and organic production. By collaborating with local institutions, schools, and health centers, PRODA fosters agricultural enterprises, promotes nutrition, and empowers communities. The program adapts to changing needs, ensuring sustainable practices and social integration while addressing food security challenges.",
