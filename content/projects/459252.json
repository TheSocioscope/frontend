  "description": "Agrovivas is an innovative organic waste collection initiative that began during the pandemic, focusing on composting to reduce landfill waste. Serving 500 families and 40 companies in Quito, Cuenca, and Guayaquil, the project transforms organic waste into compost, which is then returned to families for urban gardening and used in reforestation efforts. By promoting sustainable practices, Agrovivas aims to educate communities on the value of composting and contribute to environmental conservation.",
