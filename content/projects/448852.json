  "description": "Dansk Vegetarisk Landsforening is an NGO located in Copenhagen, established in 1896 by a group of doctors advocating for plant-based living due to health benefits observed during World War I. Initially focused on health, the organization has evolved to encompass a broader agenda that includes animal rights and sustainability. It currently employs around 25 staff members with diverse expertise in health, marketing, and sustainability, and operates primarily through project-based initiatives.\n\nOne of their significant projects is the Plant Based Association, a collaboration with Organic Denmark and other stakeholders aimed at promoting plant-based eating. The organization also engages in various collaborations with municipalities and other organizations to provide knowledge and support for transitioning to plant-based options.",
