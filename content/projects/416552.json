  "description": "\nSustainable school meals\n\nGhent opts for honest, healthy and sustainable school meals that respect people, animals and the environment.\nThe school meals in Ghent city schools and day-care centres consist of more organic ingredients, less meat and more seasonal products. Criteria such as food waste and human and animal welfare are also taken into account. With our sustainable school meals, we reach 4,500 pupils and serve 775,883 meals per year.\nOn Thursdays, all meals are vegetarian. On all other days, flexi-meals are served: this means that for each meal animal protein is limited to a maximum of 50% of the total protein content.",
