  "description": "The initiative, \"La Fresque Agréable\" workshop, focuses on addressing the challenges of agriculture and food systems. The workshop aims to foster a systemic understanding of these interconnected issues, encouraging participants to engage in discussions and collaborative problem-solving. The workshop employs a methodology inspired by the Climate Fresco, where participants work in teams to create a visual representation (a fresco) of the various phenomena and issues related to agriculture and food. This process involves connecting cards that represent different aspects of the system, allowing participants to visualize the relationships between causes and consequences. The initiative emphasizes inclusivity, aiming to bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who may not have prior experience in agriculture or food systems. It seeks to create a safe space for dialogue, understanding, and empathy, while also providing historical context to avoid judgmental attitudes.",
