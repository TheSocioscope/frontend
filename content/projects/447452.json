  "description": "Nutreets is an innovative aquaculture initiative, focused on sustainable fish farming and the ecological transition of agricultural practices. It aims to address the disconnect between modern farming practices and the economic realities of the agricultural sector. The initiative emphasizes the revival of ancestral farming techniques, updated with 21st-century technology, to create a high-performance, sustainable model that minimizes resource use and environmental impact.\n\nNutreets aims to become the largest agricultural cooperative in the Ile-de-France region, providing quality, resource-efficient products that tell a story and enhance the attractiveness of farming as a profession. The long-term vision includes expanding their network of farms to meet the growing demand for local, sustainable food in urban areas.",
