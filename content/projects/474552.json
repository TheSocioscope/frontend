  "description": "The initiative focuses on queen bee rearing in central Kenya, addressing the decline in natural bee populations due to environmental degradation. The founder, a former farmer, began this project to ensure pollination for crops. He not only breeds queen bees but also provides beehives and training to local farmers, promoting environmental awareness. This sustainable model enhances agricultural yields while producing honey and other bee products, ultimately fostering a healthier ecosystem and community engagement.",
