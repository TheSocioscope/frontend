  "description": "Soydoy focuses on addressing food security and malnutrition in communities through a dual approach of economic development and community education. It aims to empower families by helping them establish productive projects, such as community gardens, while also providing education on nutrition and healthy eating habits. The organization recognizes that simply providing resources is not enough; it emphasizes the importance of behavioral change and social cohesion within communities to ensure sustainable improvements in food security. By engaging local partners and fostering community involvement, the initiative seeks to create lasting impacts, although it faces challenges in maintaining project sustainability and achieving significant behavioral change among participants.",
