  "description": "Urban Farmers Pro is an innovative agro-technology startup based in Bogotá that specializes in hydroponic agriculture, utilizing artificial intelligence for centralized control of its production systems. This initiative allows for urban farming in limited spaces, maximizing the use of water and fertilizers while producing vegetables in a clean and chemical-free manner. The startup operates hydroponic production units, initially housed in cargo containers, which have been adapted to optimize space and resources. With a focus on high productivity, they can yield the equivalent of traditional agriculture's output from a much smaller area, while also ensuring that their products are free from pesticides and irrigated with clean drinking water. As they scale their operations to include vertical farming, Urban Farmers Pro aims to expand its market reach, targeting both individual consumers and businesses in the hospitality sector, while also exploring partnerships to bring their sustainable farming model to regions with limited access to fresh produce.",
