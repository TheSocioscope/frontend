  "description": "Postobon aims at creating long-term jobs for women through their culinary skills. Initially a neighborhood association, it evolved into a cooperative with its first restaurant opening in 2016. The project focuses on local cuisine, employing cooks from working-class neighborhoods to prepare meals reflective of their home cooking. In 2019, the catering business began to overshadow the restaurant, leading to a shift in operations. The cooperative faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic but adapted by continuing to provide meals for a youth hostel, which helped sustain the business. The initiative emphasizes community values and environmental sustainability in its operations.",
