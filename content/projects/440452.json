  "description": "Nano Freeze is a technological startup focused on innovative refrigeration solutions with significant applications in the food industry. Originating from a university project, the founders identified a critical need for sustainable refrigeration methods, particularly for low-income individuals lacking access to electricity. They developed a biodegradable refrigeration gel, which is currently in the patent process across multiple countries, including the USA and Mexico. This gel serves as the core of their product line, which includes coolers designed for transporting health samples and food exports, effectively maintaining the cold chain during transit. The company has experienced rapid growth, establishing partnerships with health organizations and food exporters, while also navigating challenges related to market acceptance and supplier relationships. Their commitment to sustainability and innovation positions them as a unique player in the refrigeration technology sector.",
