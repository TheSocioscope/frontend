  "description": "Pan Rebelde (Rebel Bread) is an initiative by the Educar de Ida y Vuelta Foundation that promotes food sovereignty through the culinary use of traditional fruits from the Quindío region. Launched in 2014, it fosters community engagement by inviting families and individuals to share recipes and participate in culinary workshops. The initiative aims to raise awareness about dietary heritage, support local food producers, and encourage sustainable eating practices, creating a space for collective learning and resistance against homogenized diets.",
