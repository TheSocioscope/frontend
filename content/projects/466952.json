  "description": "The Asoprocvilla project aims to strengthen local production and connect consumers directly with producers in Villa de Leyva. Established over 15 years ago during an agrarian strike, the initiative fosters an alternative market where local and regional producers can sell organic, artisanal, and sustainable products directly to consumers. This project not only addresses food shortages but also promotes community engagement, social interaction, and a commitment to healthy living, creating a vibrant social fabric within the community.",
