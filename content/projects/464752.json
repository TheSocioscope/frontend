  "description": "Hegnstrup is an initiative focused on sustainable organic farming, founded by Allan, who returned to his childhood home to create a community-oriented farm. Inspired by his upbringing and environmental concerns, the project emphasizes self-sufficiency, ecological practices, and community engagement. By producing a variety of crops and raising animals, Hegnstrup aims to provide high-quality, pesticide-free food while fostering a connection between people and nature. The initiative also promotes education about biodiversity and sustainable practices.",
