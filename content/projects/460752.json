  "description": "Ecomarcal is part of the Participatory Guarantee System (PGS): an agroecological certification initiative that fosters collaboration among producers, consumers, and technical experts. Established in the Andean region, it aims to create trust through a locally developed seal that certifies agroecological practices. By organizing meetings and guided visits, the PGS promotes knowledge exchange and strengthens community ties, ultimately encouraging more producers to transition to agroecology and raising consumer awareness about its benefits.",
