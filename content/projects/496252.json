  "description": "The cooperative, established in 1947 in Bejís, Castellón, unites around 150 members dedicated exclusively to olive oil production. Initially formed to consolidate small, private mills, it has evolved to focus on sustainable practices, including agro-composting and organic farming. Following devastating fires in 2022, the cooperative is committed to recovering olive groves and fostering community resilience through training and collaboration, ensuring the continuation of local traditions and sustainable agriculture.",
