  "description": "Grønt Marked focuses on establishing a vibrant farmers market in a city where such cultural practices are not prevalent. It aims to connect local producers with consumers, fostering community engagement and promoting sustainable food practices. By providing a platform for small-scale farmers, the initiative addresses the challenges of food accessibility and encourages a shift towards local, seasonal products. It also emphasizes education for farmers on effective selling strategies and product promotion, while striving to enhance food citizenship and strengthen community ties through shared culinary experiences.",
