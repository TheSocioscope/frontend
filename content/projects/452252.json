  "description": "The Finca María del Pilar project, located in Beltrán, Santiago del Estero, is a family-run initiative focused on viticulture and wine production. Established in 2011, the project began with a small test vineyard to assess the adaptability of grape varieties to the local soil and climate. Over the years, the farm has expanded to 60 hectares, with 6.5 hectares currently in production, growing various crops including vines, olive trees, and vegetables.\n\nThe project emphasizes sustainability, aiming to minimize the use of agrochemicals and promote natural farming practices. The winery is also involved in community development, employing local workers and providing training opportunities in viticulture and winemaking. The initiative has sparked the emergence of 12 additional vineyard projects in the region, fostering a collaborative environment among local producers.",
