  "description": "\nHavHøst is a Danish NGO focused on promoting sustainable food systems through community-driven initiatives centered around ocean farming. Established approximately ten years ago, it began as a voluntary association where individuals gathered to cultivate blue mussels and seaweeds. The organization aims to support the establishment of community gardens across Denmark, currently assisting around 30 such gardens and expanding its influence to a Nordic and European context.\n\nThe initiative emphasizes regenerative practices, aiming to cultivate food in a manner that enhances the marine ecosystem rather than depleting it. HavHøst's mission is to revitalize local harvests along Denmark's coast, preserving both ocean life and local fishing culture while contributing to a more sustainable food system. It focuses on education, partnering with schools to teach students about regenerative ocean farming and the importance of local food systems.\n\nHavHøst operates on a community-first approach, encouraging local initiatives rather than imposing top-down solutions. It seeks to create a viable business model for regenerative ocean farming, promoting practices that allow fishermen to diversify their activities, especially in light of declining fish populations.",
