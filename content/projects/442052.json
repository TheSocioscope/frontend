  "description": "Piñas del Llano is a company that specializes in producing dehydrated pineapple snacks in various flavors. Established in a region abundant with pineapples, the founders identified a market gap for healthy snack options amidst a local culture that predominantly favors meat-based diets. The company began with homemade dehydration methods and has since evolved into a small-scale production facility, utilizing both manual and automated processes. They emphasize sustainability by seeking to minimize waste and promote healthy eating habits, while also fostering community relationships with local farmers and suppliers.",
