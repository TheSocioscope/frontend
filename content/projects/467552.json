  "description": "The Organicos Villa Aurora initiative focuses on transforming local fruits and aromatic plants into various organic products, including infusions and yacón-based items. Originating from a family's health journey towards organic farming, the project emphasizes sustainable practices and permaculture. With a commitment to community well-being, it not only produces but also educates through workshops, fostering a holistic approach to agriculture while promoting local biodiversity and healthy living.",
