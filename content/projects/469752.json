  "description": "Honeyland is an innovative initiative focused on sustainable beekeeping and honey production. It emphasizes the development of genetically modified queen bees to enhance honey yield while promoting inclusivity in the industry, particularly for women. Founded by César Palacio, the project combines academic research with practical application, offering free knowledge sharing to aspiring beekeepers. Despite its potential, Honeyland faces challenges due to its reliance on a single individual and limited commercial viability.",
