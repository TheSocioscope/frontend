  "description": "La Huerta initiative is a sustainable hotel project located in Oca Lima. This initiative emphasizes the use of organic produce grown in its own garden, which supplies the hotel's restaurant, thereby reducing its carbon footprint and promoting regenerative tourism. The hotel employs triple impact methodologies, treating waste and utilizing wastewater to create biochemical fertilizers for the garden. Guests are engaged in experiential learning about organic farming practices, fostering a connection to the land and encouraging them to cultivate their own crops at home. The initiative also aims to create a positive local impact by hiring community members and collaborating with various organizations to promote education and sustainability, ultimately prioritizing ecological and social values over mere profit.",
