  "description": "\"Villa Angaran San Giuseppe\" is a social project of \"Rete Pictor\", a consortium of cooperatives: \"Luoghi Comuni\" (type B cooperative for job placement), \"Adelante\" (type A cooperative for personal services) and \"Conca d'Oro\" (type A and B). This project was entrusted with the recovery and rehabilitation of a 16th-century villa owned by the Jesuit Fathers, given on a free loan. The project to restore and redevelop Villa Angaran San Giuseppe started in 2015. \n\nThe project consists of a restaurant and bar (\"Todomodo\"), fields for the production of organic vegetables, day care centres for adolescents, children and persons with disability, a guest house, a liquor factory, rented spaces for events and conferences, art workshops, shared vegetable gardens for members, a vineyard, and the organisation of cultural events (\"People First Park\": concerts, readings/seminars, cultural reviews), and spaces for the sale of products from partner projects. \n\nVilla Angaran San Giuseppe is a well known meeting place for the community of Bassano del Grappa. Its approach to food production is organic and eco-friendly and subordinate to the social inclusion of the people in the day care centre. The project combines principles of environmental sustainability with social sustainability, presents itself as a place open to all differences and aspires to become a laboratory where a new idea of society is developed.
