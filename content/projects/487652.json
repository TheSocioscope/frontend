Established 30 years ago, it focuses on sustainable practices, organic farming, and community involvement. The project emphasizes holistic health through nutritious food, leveraging permaculture and agroecology principles. Gaia also participates in local organic markets, promoting awareness of the benefits of organic produce while fostering a culture of ecological responsibility.",
