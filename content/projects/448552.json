  "description": "The Food Click Living Lab initiative is a research project funded by the EU, aimed at transforming urban food systems towards greater sustainability in eight different cities, including Aarhus. The project is a collaboration between Aarhus Municipality, Aarhus University, and various stakeholders involved in the local food system. It has been running for three years and is set to conclude in 2027.\n\nThe initiative focuses on collecting and analyzing data to create and implement interventions that engage all stakeholders across the food value chain. The primary goals include changing consumer behavior, particularly reducing meat consumption, and connecting children with local farms to enhance their understanding of food sources and nature. The project emphasizes the importance of political support and community engagement for the sustainability of its interventions beyond the funding period",
