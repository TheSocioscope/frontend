  "description": "The Long Table is a community-focused project led by Tom Herbert, who has a background in baking and a strong belief in the importance of communal eating. Located in the Brimscomb Mill, the Long Table operates on a \"pay as you can\" model, allowing individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds to share meals together without stigma. The initiative emphasizes dignity, equality, and community, fostering an environment where everyone can eat together, regardless of their financial situation.\n\nThe Long Table has been successful in providing over 40,000 meals in a year, supported by a network of local farms and sustainable food practices. It operates with a commitment to paying all employees a full wage and has developed partnerships with local organizations, including the Church of England, which has provided funding and support. The project also incorporates various community services, such as a bike repair shop and a furniture bank, creating a holistic approach to community engagement.",
