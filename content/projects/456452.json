  "description": "This initiative focuses on promoting agroecology as a sustainable and socially responsible model for agricultural production. It began over 20 years ago as a grassroots movement aimed at addressing environmental and social challenges. The organization brings together local producers to market organic products, including chocolate and various farm goods, while fostering community solidarity and knowledge sharing. Through a participatory guarantee system, it ensures the integrity of its products and supports the livelihoods of its members. The initiative emphasizes collaboration, education, and resilience in the face of economic and political challenges.",
