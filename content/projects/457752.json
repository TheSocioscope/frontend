  "description": "The initiative focuses on managing surplus food resources in Paraguay, particularly from the gastronomic sector, to combat food waste. Founded by Jimena Mendoza in 2017, it operates as a social enterprise, emphasizing sustainability and social impact. The organization collaborates with supermarkets, restaurants, and events to collect excess food, redistributing it to vulnerable communities. With a small team, they aim to expand their model to other cities while addressing challenges related to regulations and competition.",
