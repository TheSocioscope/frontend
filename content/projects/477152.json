  "description": "Zipporah Ochoi is a chicken farmer in Kenya's coastal region who aims to uplift local communities by providing free chickens to women and youth. Her initiative serves as a business grant, enabling recipients to start their own chicken farming ventures. This model not only fosters entrepreneurship but also addresses food supply needs in an area heavily reliant on tourism. Zipporah's efforts are transforming lives, enabling community members to become self-sufficient chicken farmers.               ",
