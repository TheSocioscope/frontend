  "description": "Asodeleite is an association of women who have created a brand called Atornitas, specializing in the production of banana chips from locally grown plantains. This venture emerged during the pandemic when many members faced unemployment and sought ways to utilize their agricultural resources effectively. The association began as a grassroots effort to address economic challenges, leading to the development of a product that is 100% natural and free from additives. Throughout eight years, the company has been recognized both nationally and internationally for its commitment to sustainability and the circular economy, highlighting its incursion into the Mexican market. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of creating healthy and organic products, with careful traceability from production to the consumer.",
