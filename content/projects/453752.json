  "description": "Tyddynteg focuses on a cooperatively run regenerative farm that has been operational for nearly a decade. It emphasizes sustainable vegetable farming without livestock, fostering community engagement through a vegetable box scheme and on-site shop. The cooperative structure promotes shared ownership and equitable pay among members, ensuring that all tasks are valued equally. The farm draws inspiration from regenerative practices rooted in Palestinian culture, aiming to build resilience against political and economic changes. Additionally, it serves as a community asset, hosting events to strengthen social ties and promote awareness around food systems.",
