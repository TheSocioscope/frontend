  "description": "La Ferme du Trichon focuses on transforming an urban space into a community-driven farm, addressing food transition and social issues. It began with local residents and volunteers revitalizing a neglected plot of land to create a shared garden. The project aims to engage the community through educational workshops, solidarity food baskets, and cooking classes, promoting healthy eating and sustainable practices. It also involves scientific collaboration to assess and improve soil quality, ensuring the production of affordable, organic vegetables while fostering social connections and empowerment among participants.",
