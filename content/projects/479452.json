  "description": "The Earth Focus Foundation, established in 2019, operates in the Kanha Tiger Reserve, focusing on empowering tribal communities through education and nature-based livelihoods. The initiative aims to restore dignity and self-sufficiency by addressing the lack of education and sustainable income sources. By engaging with local communities, the foundation promotes agroforestry and educational programs, fostering resilience against distress migration and enhancing overall quality of life. Their holistic approach emphasizes collaboration and community-driven solutions.",
