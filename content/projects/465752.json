  "description": "The initiative focuses on creating a natural health center in Costa Rica. Their eco-farm spans approximately 3 hectares, where they cultivate medicinal plants, fruit trees, and vegetables. Initially, they attracted students and volunteers to learn about natural health care, but now their primary income comes from selling herbal products at local farmers' markets. Their mission is to improve community health through sustainable practices while promoting awareness of herbal medicine. The initiative emphasizes self-sufficiency and aims to inspire others to adopt healthier lifestyles.",
