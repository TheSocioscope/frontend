  "description": "Changing Food aims to improve the quality of food in Copenhagen’s public kitchens by integrating sustainable practices and increasing the use of organic ingredients. Launched in December 2019, the initiative focuses on evaluating and enhancing food practices in public kitchens, with an emphasis on sustainability and chef education.\n\nThe process begins with an assessment of the kitchens, including an analysis of food procurement and waste, followed by the development of new programs to improve food preparation. Training sessions are also offered to teach chefs how to cook with local and seasonal ingredients. The initiative seeks to empower kitchen staff by providing them with knowledge about food sourcing, which can enhance their motivation and professional pride.\n\nChanging Food also aims to expand its model to other European countries, building on positive results from pilot projects, such as one conducted in Berlin. The initiative highlights the importance of a holistic approach to food sustainability, considering both the environmental and social impacts of food production.",
