  "description": "Del Peix Al Plat focuses on raising awareness about local fish consumption and sustainable fishing practices. Originating from a personal motivation, it aims to educate the community about the importance of local seafood and the environmental impact of fishing. Through informative talks, guided visits to fishing quays, and cooking classes, the initiative seeks to connect consumers with local fishermen and promote the consumption of less-known fish species. Despite facing challenges from some sectors of the fishing community, it strives to foster a deeper understanding of marine sustainability and the significance of local resources.",
