  "description": "The Swiss Food Academy initiative focuses on food education for children in school settings. It was established in 2017 following an initial experience with Swiss Food Revolution, which failed due to differing visions. The academy aims to raise awareness among children, particularly those aged 6 to 12, about the importance of healthy and sustainable eating.\n\nThe program is divided into two main components: the Gaia Program, which engages children in practical and theoretical workshops on food, and the Paprika Program, which focuses on food education in schools. The workshops are led by experts and include playful activities to encourage children's participation, with the goal of turning them into ambassadors of healthy eating within their families.\n\nSwiss Food Academy collaborates with various stakeholders, including chefs, nutritionists, and academic institutions, to enrich its programs. The organization strives to meet local needs for food education by adapting to the realities of Geneva's urban neighborhoods. It has also received significant support from public authorities and has been recognized for its role in the food transition.",
