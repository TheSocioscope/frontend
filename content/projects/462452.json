  "description": "Zoe Farms and Fisheries, founded in 2021, began as a small backyard garden, growing vegetables for home consumption, and has grown into a thriving four-acre farm. The initiative focuses on vegetable farming and community empowerment, particularly for women, by providing training and resources. By reinvesting profits, the farm aims to combat hunger and improve food security in the community, while also addressing gender-based violence through economic independence.
