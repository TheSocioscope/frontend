  "description": "Quivicol is an initiative focused on promoting organic and regenerative agriculture through the development and distribution of bio-inputs and microbial products. The initiative emerged from a recognition of the growing demand for sustainable agricultural practices and the need for alternatives to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Quivicol aims to provide small and large producers with effective, low-cost solutions that enhance crop quality, improve soil health, and ensure traceability of agricultural products. The initiative seeks to expand its reach and impact, particularly in the northern region of Tolima, by establishing biofactories and collaborating with local farmers and institutions to promote sustainable practices.",
