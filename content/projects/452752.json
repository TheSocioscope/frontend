  "description": "The Río Negro Agroecological Collective, based in Viedma, Argentina, emerged from socio-economic crises, including the 2001 financial collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic. This initiative unites 10-12 producer families, primarily from the Bolivian community, to promote agroecological practices that prioritize healthy, natural products while ensuring fair working conditions. Supported by national institutions, the collective has grown significantly, establishing a successful agroecological fair that connects local consumers with sustainable food sources.",
