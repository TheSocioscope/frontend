  "description": "Make Eat is an innovative initiative, aimed at revolutionizing gastronomy by integrating design and creativity into the culinary world. The initiative began as a consultancy focused on applying design principles to gastronomy, addressing the lack of investment in innovation within the food industry. \nOne of their notable projects is \"Food for Good,\" which emerged during the pandemic to address food waste by redistributing surplus food from restaurants to vulnerable populations. This initiative successfully provided over 55,000 meals, including high-quality dishes from Michelin-starred chefs. The initiative is characterized by a commitment to education, open-source knowledge sharing, and a holistic approach to food sustainability, aiming to influence consumer habits and promote a deeper understanding of food sources and their environmental impact.
