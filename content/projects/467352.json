  "description": "Setas Fresh is a family-owned initiative in Colombia that specializes in cultivating orellanas, a nutritious fruit. Founded in 2015, it emerged from the resilience of its founder's mother after losing her flower crop in 2009. The project emphasizes sustainability and circular economy practices, utilizing waste for compost and reusing water. With support from Fondo Emprender, Setas Fresh has established a stable market presence, focusing on both fresh and processed products while promoting health benefits associated with orellanas.",
