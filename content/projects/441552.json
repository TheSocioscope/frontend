  "description": "Diego Miels focuses on sustainable beekeeping in Tuluá, Valle del Cauca, where honey and its derivatives are produced through ecological practices. The founder, motivated by a desire to diversify agricultural income beyond traditional coffee farming, embarked on a journey to establish a beekeeping business. This venture not only aims to generate profit but also emphasizes the importance of bees in maintaining ecosystems, as they play a crucial role in pollination. The founder has successfully expanded the business, created educational programs for aspiring beekeepers, and developed a range of natural products, including honey-based cosmetics. The initiative serves as a model for demonstrating that success can be achieved in rural areas without abandoning the countryside, promoting both environmental sustainability and economic viability.",
