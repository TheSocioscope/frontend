What strategies of resilience can be established in urban development, urban design, urban planning, infrastructure planning (e.g. waterscapes, transport systems) and landscape architecture? What can we learn from the coronavirus crisis and what design solutions are at our disposal to make our cities more resilient and more future-proof? How do we plan and design greener, healthier, human-centered, sustainable and resilient urban spaces and architecture? ",
