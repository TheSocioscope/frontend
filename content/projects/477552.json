  "description": "Dennis leads the Regional Coalition for Farmers Markets, which creates community spaces for farmers to sell directly to consumers, eliminating middlemen. This model shortens the supply chain, promoting a healthier food system by fostering relationships between producers and consumers. The coalition aims to expand farmers' markets across communities, advocating for local food production and value addition. Dennis believes that consumer demand for transparency in food sourcing can drive change in agricultural practices.",
