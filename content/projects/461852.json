  "description": "Bowline was a collaborative initiative formed during the COVID-19 crisis, bringing together restaurant owners, chefs, students, and academics in Copenhagen. The project aimed to support local restaurants facing unprecedented challenges. Through workshops, surveys, and shared resources, Bowline fostered a spirit of community and collaboration, addressing industry issues that had been overlooked before the pandemic. Although the organization has since dissolved, its legacy of cooperation continues among its members.",
