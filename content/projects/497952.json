  "description": "The initiative focuses on harnessing the potential of the black soldier fly for various applications, including waste degradation and the development of new antibiotics. Based at the Andean Amazonian Laboratory of Chemistry of Life, the project aims to produce insect protein and explore the fly's microbiota for antimicrobial properties. By addressing organic waste management and enhancing food safety, the initiative contributes to sustainable practices in agriculture and aquaculture, ultimately benefiting human health and the environment.",
