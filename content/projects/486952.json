  "description": "The initiative focuses on the cultivation and marketing of edible mushrooms in Colombia, particularly the orellana variety. It began in 2014 when an agricultural engineer recognized a growing interest in mushrooms and decided to pursue an alternative path to traditional agricultural practices, which often involve monoculture. Ticsa Takal combines the concepts of origin and fruit, emphasizing the importance of knowing where food comes from and how it is grown. Overall, the initiative seeks to educate consumers about the benefits of mushrooms, foster a network of local growers, and create a sustainable business model that prioritizes health, transparency, and ethical practices in food production.",
