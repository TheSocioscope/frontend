  "description": "Resto Zero is an initiative that began in 2016 with the goal of addressing the environmental issues caused by coffee waste in Peru, one of the world's top coffee producers. The project focuses on utilizing coffee husks, which, if left untreated, can release methane and contaminate groundwater. Resto Cero has developed a product from these husks that is sold to a major client, Fidelia Tea, for use in infusions. They are also researching coffee husk flour, which has potential digestive benefits and could be exported.",
