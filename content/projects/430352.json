  "description": "Casa delle Sementi - CONSEMI was a project funded by the European Community from 2019 to 2022 for the conservation and valorisation of seeds of ancient and local cereal varieties in the Veneto region, Italy. The project also aimed to develop innovative, local and sustainable seed and processed product management chains, so as to fully express the values of biodiversity, sustainability and a local economy. CONSEMI consorted several organic farmers' associations in Veneto. The seed cultures were mainly hosted at the Azienda Agricola Cortana Giandomenico in Isola Vicentina (VI). The farm hosts 44 plots of various sizes, most of them dedicated to monocot (einkorn) grains. CONSEMI evolved in 2022 into the new TERA project, which intends to build on the results achieved so far and consolidate the development of the short supply chain started by CONSEMI. ",
