  "description": "Aromáticas del Alto Valle is a cooperative focused on the production and commercialization of aromatic and medicinal herbs. Established over 20 years ago, it gained momentum during the pandemic by embracing digital commerce. The initiative promotes productive diversification for local families, allowing small-scale farming of herbs that were previously undervalued. With a commitment to agroecological standards, the cooperative has evolved to include online marketing and training, ensuring sustainability and growth in the sector.",
