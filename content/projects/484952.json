  "description": "The initiative, known as AMAP (Association for the Maintenance of Peasant Agriculture), connects local producers with consumers in the Murat region. Founded in 2011, it promotes organic farming and supports local agriculture by allowing members to pre-order products, ensuring producers know what to cultivate. The collective operates on a volunteer basis, fostering community ties and providing high-quality, locally sourced food while maintaining a flexible and supportive environment for both producers and consumers.",
