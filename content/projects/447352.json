Bio&Lo aims to create a more equitable supply chain for organic farming.\n\nThe core mission of Bio&Lo is to empower farmers by providing them with micro-dairy solutions that allow them to process their milk independently and sell their yogurt directly, thereby reducing reliance on large distributors. The initiative emphasizes short distribution circuits and bulk sales, aiming to enhance farmers' autonomy and profitability.",
