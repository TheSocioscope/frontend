  "description": "La Ruche qui dit Oui is an initiative that connects farmers and food artisans directly with consumers through a network of local communities called \"hives.\" Established in 2011, the initiative operates in seven European countries and emphasizes direct sales, local sourcing, and community engagement. The initiative aims to promote a fair food system by creating a decentralized business model that gives communities the ability to sell their products directly. It promotes transparency in pricing, ensuring that producers receive a significant share of sales, and fosters social connections among community members.",
