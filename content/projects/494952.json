  "description": "The initiative focuses on addressing the scarcity of animal feed in Rwanda through innovative hydroponic technology. Established in 2020, Uruhimbi Kageyo Cooperative (UKC) aims to produce green fodder efficiently, utilizing vertical cultivation methods that allow for rapid growth and high yield, thereby enhancing animal husbandry practices. The initiative emerged from a cooperative model, initially inspired by a government program that provided cows to vulnerable families. Recognizing the challenges posed by limited arable land and high feed prices, the team sought solutions through hydroponics, which allows for feed production without soil. The initiative has received recognition from various organizations, including the World Food Program, and has established partnerships with entities such as the MasterCard Foundation and UNDP to enhance capacity building and technology access for smallholder farmers.",
