  "description": "Nutribanana focuses on transforming discarded bananas into value-added products, spearheaded by a community of women who are victims of armed conflict. Originating from a small clay oven project initiated by a displaced mother, the venture has evolved over the years into a more sophisticated operation that produces dehydrated fruits, banana chips, and other banana-based products. The initiative emphasizes sustainability by utilizing biodegradable packaging and minimizing waste through composting techniques. It aims to empower local women by providing employment opportunities and fostering entrepreneurial skills, while also seeking to expand its market reach beyond the local community.",
