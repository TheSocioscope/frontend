  "description": "Sembrando Habitos Cosechando Salud (Sowing Habits, Harvesting Healthy Practices) project began after winning second place in a university competition. It aims to improve eating habits among 480 children at Our Lady of the Rosary school by integrating chicken farming and composting with educational activities. The project emphasizes the importance of teamwork, transparency, and communication among its four main collaborators. Future plans involve expanding vegetable cultivation and addressing childhood obesity through a new initiative called Xucoico Peru.",
