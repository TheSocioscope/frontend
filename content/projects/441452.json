  "description": "MAQUINNOVACIÓN focuses on the development of machines, which are designed to create edible and biodegradable food containers, such as plates, cones, and spoons, using sustainable materials. Originating from a socially conscious perspective, the initiative aims to address environmental issues related to plastic waste by providing alternatives that can be consumed along with the food they hold. The founder, who has a background in machinery production, identified a gap in the market for smaller, more accessible machines for local producers, particularly in a stigmatized area known for its entrepreneurial spirit. The initiative not only emphasizes innovation and sustainability but also incorporates a social component by employing local graduates and individuals with disabilities, fostering community engagement and support for small-scale producers. As the business grows, there are plans for international expansion and further investment in product branding, highlighting the potential for scalability and positive environmental impact.",
