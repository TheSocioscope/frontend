  "description": "The Drive Inn project, initiated in 1999, is a collective of farmers who transformed a former dumping site into a thriving urban farm in Dar es Salaam. This group of 19 farmers cultivates a variety of vegetables, selling directly to customers, including local restaurants and hotels. They emphasize sustainable farming practices, utilizing organic fertilizers and natural remedies. Over the years, they have faced challenges related to land value and water access but remain committed to food sustainability and community engagement.",
