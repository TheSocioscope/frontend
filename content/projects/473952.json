  "description": "The Kibois breeders are a rural empowerment project in Kenya, providing quality breeding stock to smallholder farmers across ten counties. The initiative aims to enhance livestock genetics, enabling farmers to achieve better weight gain in sheep, thus improving their livelihoods. The project began in 2020 and has since expanded, with partnerships from the government and NGOs. The initiative emphasizes the importance of proper breeding practices, record-keeping, and community training to ensure sustainable farming. The farm has grown to about five acres, housing 200 to 500 sheep, and aims to become a model for breeding practices in the region. Isaac's vision includes expanding Kibois' reach nationally and internationally, promoting quality livestock and supporting local economies.",
