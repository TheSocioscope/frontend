  "description": "Les Râteleurs is an association that focuses on promoting food sovereignty and social development in a region facing significant socio-economic challenges. The initiative aims to empower local residents, particularly those in precarious situations, through initiatives centered around self-production and food education.\n\nLes Râteleurs aims to restore individuals' sense of ownership over their food by providing resources, skills training, and fostering connections between residents, local producers, and authorities. Their approach includes establishing shared gardens, conducting door-to-door surveys to assess food practices, and creating cooking workshops that encourage community engagement and knowledge sharing.",
