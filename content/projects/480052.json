  "description": "The Banco de Alimentos de Bogotá, established in 2000, is a non-profit foundation aimed at reducing food waste and combating hunger. It operates by collecting surplus food from companies and redistributing it to legally recognized organizations that support vulnerable populations. The bank emphasizes a model where food is not given away for free but provided at a nominal cost, ensuring accountability and sustainability. It collaborates with various stakeholders, including local parishes and community organizations, to maximize its impact.",
