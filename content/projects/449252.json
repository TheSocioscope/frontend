  "description": "Eaternity is an initiative based in Zurich, Switzerland, focused on calculating the CO2 emissions associated with food. The organization aims to promote sustainable practices by providing tools that help individuals and businesses make informed decisions regarding their food consumption. The initiative began with a pilot project at ETH University, which garnered recognition and support, leading to the development of a software platform that allows restaurants and other clients to calculate their food-related carbon footprints.\n\nEaternity operates as a social enterprise, balancing its mission of environmental sustainability with the need to generate revenue. The organization has successfully engaged with various clients, including city canteens and restaurants, by offering a subscription-based service that covers operational costs and provides detailed reports on CO2 emissions. Their software has evolved from a DIY approach using Excel to a more sophisticated open-source system that emphasizes transparency and accuracy in calculations",
