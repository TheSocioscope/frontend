  "description": "Bandes de Cheffes is a social and eco-responsible catering initiative, aimed at providing paid employment to exiled women, particularly refugee cheffes. Established in September 2021, the initiative focuses on professional integration within a sustainable framework, emphasizing organic, local, and seasonal food sourcing, as well as minimizing waste and single-use packaging.\n\nThe organization operates as a service provider for events, catering to both corporate clients (B2B) and the general public (B2C), with a mission to raise awareness about sustainable catering and migration issues. It seeks to challenge stereotypes surrounding refugee women by showcasing their culinary skills through innovative adaptations of traditional recipes into high-quality offerings.\n\nBandes de Cheffes also emphasizes the personal and professional development of its chefs, encouraging them to take on various responsibilities beyond cooking, such as logistics and customer service. The initiative has formed partnerships with cultural institutions, where it provides brunch services and engages with the public to promote its mission.",
