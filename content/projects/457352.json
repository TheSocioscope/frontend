  "description": "The initiative involves the establishment of an ecological workshop at APF France Handicap in Calais, focusing on the production of insect-based products as a sustainable source of protein. The project aims to create a range of products, including dehydrated insect flour and biscuits that incorporate insect protein, catering to the growing demand for alternative protein sources. The workshop employs 68 disabled individuals, providing them with meaningful work while promoting ecological practices. The initiative also explores the use of insect waste as a natural fertilizer, further contributing to sustainable agriculture. Overall, the project seeks to transition towards healthier diets by introducing innovative protein options that are environmentally friendly.",
