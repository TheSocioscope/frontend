  "description": "The TESO Women Development Initiative focuses on empowering local communities in Uganda through sustainable practices. They recycle agricultural waste into clean cooking briquettes, provide capacity building for smallholder farmers, and develop irrigation systems using locally sourced materials. The initiative also promotes women's financial literacy through savings groups and supports the production of improved cooking stoves. By enhancing food security and resilience, they aim to improve household nutrition and reduce deforestation.",
