  "description": "The initiative focuses on the extraction of genipin from the huito fruit, aiming to utilize agro-industrial waste to create a natural dye for the food industry. Launched in 2018, the project addresses environmental pollution caused by the disposal of huito pulp, peel, and seeds, which are typically discarded after the fruit is used for making nectars and cosmetics. The extraction process employs innovative techniques, including supercritical fluid extraction and ultrasonic extraction, to obtain genipin while minimizing environmental impact. The initiative not only seeks to provide a sustainable source of natural blue dye, which is rare and difficult to obtain, but also aims to enhance the economic benefits for local farmers by promoting the use of all parts of the huito fruit.",
