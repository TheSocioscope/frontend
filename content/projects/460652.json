  "description": "Queseria Ventimiglia started a cheese factory in 2009 as a family hobby on a farm, inspired by childhood memories of traditional food. The business grew from a small-scale hobby to a recognized cheese factory, producing around 15,000 to 20,000 liters of milk monthly. They emphasize quality and sustainability in their practices, using regenerative grazing methods. Their cheeses gained popularity among chefs and consumers, leading to awards and recognition in international competitions. Today, they aim to enhance their production capacity and develop a tourist attraction at the farm.",
