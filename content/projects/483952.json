  "description": "The initiative \"C'est qui le patron?\" aims to empower consumers by allowing them to choose products that ensure fair compensation for producers. Inspired by projects collecting imperfect vegetables that would otherwise be thrown out,  the initiative was founded in 2016, with a milk product, encouraging consumers to pay a little more to support farmers. The cooperative model fosters direct connections between producers and consumers, promoting transparency and sustainability in food production while challenging traditional pricing norms in the market.",
