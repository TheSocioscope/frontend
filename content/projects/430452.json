  "description": "Mulino Terrevive is a stone-milled and bronze-drawn mill and pasta factory. It represents a central node between the producers of ancient grains and the market as a 100% organic food processor attentive to the preservation of all the organoleptic, taste and chemical principles of flours. It is a mill descending from a long family tradition, now in its fourth generation. Mulino Terrevive boasts a large network of first-rate grain suppliers and traders and contractors who promote its products on a large scale. It is also one of the most important suppliers of flour and pasta to social farms and other businesses in the Veneto region (Italy) that promote the food use of ancient grains, the short supply chain and the defence of local grain biodiversity. The mill has a sales outlet where pasta, fresh bread and other baked goods can be purchased. The company prides itself on redeveloping the role of the farmer and ancient culinary traditions, respect and service to the local community. ",
