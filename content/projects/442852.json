  "description": "Ferme Soutana Petit Radis is a family project focused on sustainable food, which has evolved from the creation of a farm in the 90s to the opening of a restaurant in 2018 and a patisserie in 2020. The family is committed to promoting a “farm to table” approach, growing organic produce to supply their restaurant and creating cakes from local ingredients. Despite the challenges of profitability and sourcing, the family aspires to expand their model by opening other establishments while maintaining a strong connection with their local community.",
