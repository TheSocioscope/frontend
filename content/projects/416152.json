  "description": "Free land for sustainable production\nGhent invests in agricultural land for local and sustainable production.\nThe Goedinge is a pilot project in which 10 hectares of land - owned by the City of Ghent - is put on the market for free for local, sustainable food production, to be sold to the urban population. This pilot project enables experimentation with criteria for sustainable agriculture, cooperation and social aspects of food production.\nThe lessons learned from the Goedinge project will help develop new models that can be rolled out on public farmland in the coming years.",
