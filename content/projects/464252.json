  "description": "Footprint Nordic, founded in May 2021, is a nonprofit initiative aimed at promoting regenerative agriculture through collaboration between chefs, farmers, and the hospitality industry. The organization runs two key programs: the 1% Initiative, which connects consumers to sustainable farming by adding a small surcharge to restaurant bills, and the Top 50 Farmers project, which highlights exemplary farmers across Europe. Together, these initiatives seek to empower farmers and foster a sustainable food system.",
