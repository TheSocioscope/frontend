  "description": "Eixarcolant, founded in 2016, is an initiative aimed at recovering forgotten plants, particularly wild edible species and traditional agricultural varieties. Originating from ethnobotanical research in the Noya region, it seeks to transform agri-food systems by reintegrating these plants into local culinary practices. The initiative fosters community engagement through workshops, research, and a seed bank, promoting biodiversity and sustainable food practices while preserving cultural heritage linked to these forgotten plants.",
