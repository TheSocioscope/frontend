  "description": "Ghent en Garde tackles different challenges through tailor-made responses. By preventing food waste and helping promote shorter food supply chains, Ghent en Garde plays an essential role in reducing emissions. Since 2014, over 42 schools have received training in how to develop community garden beds on their campus, with other 240 parents and teachers having participated in these workshops. No less than 25 community gardens have already received support. An online helpdesk has also been developed where citizens can ask questions about their own vegetable garden, no matter how small. The scheme is meant to encourage the public to participate in greening activities at community level and to adopt greening activities as part of daily life. It also aims at arousing public awareness in greening and environmental protection from the youngest age through participating in gardening activities.",
