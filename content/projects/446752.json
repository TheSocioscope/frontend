  "description": "La Chorba is an association established in 1998, originating from a squat in Paris, focused on providing hot meals and food parcels to vulnerable populations, particularly during the winter months. The initiative emphasizes dignity by allowing beneficiaries to enjoy meals seated rather than standing in line. La Chorba operates primarily from two sites: a year-round refectory at Porte de la Villette, serving around 800 meals daily, and a winter site at the Town Hall, accommodating 250 people each evening.\n\nThe organization distributes food parcels every other Saturday to approximately 2,000 individuals, mainly single-parent families, at a nominal cost. This service was developed in response to the pandemic, recognizing that certain demographics were overlooked in traditional food aid distributions. La Chorba is committed to its humanitarian mission, focusing on providing meals, social connections, and guidance to help beneficiaries regain autonomy.",
