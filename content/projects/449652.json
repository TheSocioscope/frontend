  "description": "Street Goat is a community-run initiative based in Bristol, England, that began in 2016. The project focuses on grazing goats in urban spaces that are currently underutilized, with the aim of providing access to milk, fiber, and meat for community members who participate in the care and maintenance of the goats. The initiative operates on a loose, informal structure without formal registration, allowing for quick decision-making and adaptability.\n\nThe project consists of approximately four to five grazing areas around Bristol, housing around 30 to 40 goats. It attracts a diverse group of volunteers, including both younger individuals seeking access to high-quality food and older, retired individuals with more time to dedicate. Participants benefit from affordable access to healthy food, fostering a sense of food sovereignty and connection to the animals they care for.\n\nStreet Goat emphasizes the importance of understanding the food production process, providing educational opportunities about animal husbandry and the realities of food sourcing. The initiative also addresses mental health benefits through interaction with the goats, creating a unique community space that promotes well-being.\n",
