  "description": "The Kilifi Beauty Jewel initiative in Kenya focuses on repurposing coconut shells into beautiful jewelry and home utensils. Originating from local traditions, this project not only preserves cultural heritage but also provides income for the community. Despite challenges, such as land conflicts and limited market access, the initiative employs local artisans and aims to create sustainable livelihoods while promoting eco-friendly practices. The goal is to enhance visibility and direct market access for their unique products.",
