  "description": "Urban Agriculture Magazine no. 30 – Rural-urban linkages\nThis issue of Farming Matters and Urban Agriculture Magazine is a co-production between ILEIA and RUAF Foundation. RUAF draws from grounded experiences in urban agriculture and food systems and ILEIA from family farming and agroecology. We see this as an opportunity to explore and affirm the rural-urban linkages in renewing our food systems, and in the process to create a thorough and in-depth ‘twin’ issue of our magazines on rural–urban linkages.",
