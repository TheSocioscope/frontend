  "description": "Molinillito is a sustainable food technology company founded in Ibagué, Colombia. The company focuses on producing eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastic mixers commonly used in hot beverages like coffee and tea. The primary product is a sugar stick grinder made from natural ingredients such as sugar, panela, and honey, designed to eliminate the need for plastic mixers. The initiative began in 2015, driven by a commitment to reduce pollution and promote sustainability, particularly in the coffee industry, which is a significant contributor to plastic waste. The company underwent extensive research and development, leading to the creation of a minimum viable product (MVP) and securing patents for their innovative technology. By 2021, Molinillito had established a production plant, received necessary health certifications, and gained recognition as a green business.",
