  "description": "Sabores y Vida is a project that focuses on agroecological production and processing of food. Initially aimed at growing food for personal consumption, the project evolved as they began to sell surplus crops, including beans, strawberries, and herbs. Alongside its commitment to fair trade practices, the initiative also emphasizes the importance of food security and sovereignty, encouraging producers to grow food for their own consumption alongside commercial crops. The initiative has received recognition through awards, including the \"Antojate de Antioquie,\" which has helped establish its credibility and market presence. ",
