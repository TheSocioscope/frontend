  "description": "Re-Belle is an initiative focused on revalorizing food waste by producing premium jams made from over-ripe or damaged fruit. The project aims to combine food waste reduction with social integration, particularly targeting women in vulnerable situations in the 93 département. The company operates as a back-to-work site, providing training and support for individuals facing social challenges, while also engaging in environmental awareness-raising activities.\n\nRe-Belle employs around 45 people, including approximately 30 on integration programs, and relies on a hybrid business model that combines public funding and revenue from jam sales. Future plans include diversifying product offerings and expanding awareness-raising activities to further promote sustainable food practices.\n",
