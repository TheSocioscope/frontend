  "description": "Bulgarian Organic Products Association (Bioprodukti) is an association of 270 farmers, producers, traders and researchers of organic products. It was established in 2009 to support and develop organic farming in Bulgaria. The association is run almost entirely by volunteers. It works to improve the legislative environment in the country and helps farmers to meet the requirements of organic production, as well as to deal with the administrative work related to obtaining certificates and accessing the available funds for biological farming.  One of the main activities of Bioproducts is the expansion of the market for biological products through information campaigns and participation in trade fairs and markets.",
