  "description": "The initiative, Espigoladors, was launched in 2014 to address food waste and promote the right to healthy, sustainable food amidst the ongoing social and economic crisis. It aims to reduce food losses through urban gleaning, connecting surplus food from farmers to those in need while generating employment and training opportunities for marginalized groups. By reviving the ancient practice of gleaning, Espigoladors fosters community engagement and raises awareness about food sustainability and waste reduction.",
