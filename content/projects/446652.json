  "description": "Nona is a start-up initiative aiming at transforming the catering industry, particularly in canteens, through a comprehensive management application. The initiative seeks to provide operational support to canteens by optimizing their food ordering, menu design, and overall management processes. Nona's application serves as a centralized tool that connects canteen chefs with local suppliers, enabling them to access a vast database of food products, including seasonal and sustainable options.\n\nThe initiative also focuses on fostering collaboration among various stakeholders, including local authorities, producers, and suppliers, to create a supportive ecosystem for canteens.\n\nAdditionally, Nona conducts assessments of canteen purchasing practices, provides statistical monitoring, and assists with equipment procurement to facilitate the transition to sustainable food practices. By bringing together all players involved in the food supply chain, Nona aims to create partnerships that enhance the quality and sustainability of meals served in canteens, ultimately contributing to a broader food transition in society.",
