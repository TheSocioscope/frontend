  "description": "Can we substantially modify consumer behaviour with labels on the packaging indicating the quality of the foods? The EU regulation encourages to indicate nutritional quality on the packaging. There are hopes that a similar labelling on environmental impact of the product could also change consumer behaviour. \nTo examine whether four pre-selected front-of-pack nutrition labels improve food purchases in real-life grocery shopping settings, we put 1.9 million labels on 1266 food products in four categories in 60 supermarkets and analyzed the nutritional quality of 1,668,301 purchases using the FSA nutrient profiling score. Effect sizes were 17 times smaller on average than those found in comparable laboratory studies. The most effective nutrition label, Nutri-Score, increased the purchases of foods in the top third of their category nutrition-wise by 14%, but had no impact on the purchases of foods with medium, low, or unlabeled nutrition quality. Therefore, Nutri-Score only improved the nutritional quality of the basket of labeled foods purchased by 2.5% (−0.142 FSA points). Nutri-Score’s performance improved with the variance (but not the mean) of the nutritional quality of the category. In-store surveys suggest that Nutri-Score’s ability to attract attention and help shoppers rank products by nutritional quality may explain its performance.\nIn sum, while the results are significant, the size of the effect is minor. This suggests that such a labelling approach in itself is not enough to produce change at the level needed, and should be complemented with other interventions and regulation.",
