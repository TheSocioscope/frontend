  "description": "The Growing Hope project supports farmers in the Perico Negro area through the establishment of satellite farms. Initially, 15 farms were assessed, revealing issues like monoculture and poor resource management. The initiative focuses on training farmers in land diversification and sustainable practices, leading to the creation of nine satellite farms. This project not only enhances food production but also fosters community engagement and awareness of the value of their land for sustainable agriculture.",
