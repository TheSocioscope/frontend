  "description": "The H LAB project offers the opportunity to carry, around the artistic collective Parti Poétique and the Zone Sensible site (Saint Denis, France), a full-scale concrete study of the cultural, ecological and social biodiversity that make the city. This project will set the methodology to quantify environmental and social added value of one hectare dedicated to art and food production, including (but not exclusively) entry and exit of organic matter, entry and exit of the public (number of visitors, class visits, implementation of an \"art science\" program), improvement of the dietary balance of the inhabitants, consideration of biodiversity in its living environment,...\nIn addition, the project is ambitious insofar as it wants to be replicable on the scale of all major national agglomerations, in order to show how the conservation of hectares dedicated to cultural and environmental projects can be a vector of direct added value for the territory.\n",
