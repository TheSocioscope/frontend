  "description": "The Botellas de Amor Foundation focuses on recycling contaminated plastic waste that typically ends up in landfills. By compacting this plastic into bottles, they create a dense material known as \"plastic wood,\" which is used to construct schools, playgrounds, and housing. Their dual mission addresses environmental sustainability and social needs, aiming to reduce plastic pollution while tackling the housing deficit in Latin America. The foundation operates through community engagement and partnerships with various organizations.",
