  "description": "Pescartes is an association of artisanal fishermen in Cabo de Gata, Spain, representing small-scale fishers who use sustainable practices. Established 18 years ago, it aims to amplify the voices of these fishermen in discussions with authorities, particularly regarding fishing regulations and marine conservation. The association faces challenges, including limited access to decision-making tables and funding, while striving to preserve traditional fishing knowledge and promote local seafood within the community.",
