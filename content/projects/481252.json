Based in Caldas, its key initiatives include the development of a bee identification guide, participation in educational fairs, and collaboration with local institutions like SENA and Corpocaldas to enhance community knowledge and practices related to bees. The foundation also focuses on eco-technologies, such as teaching communities to make soap from used oils and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. With a focus on native bees, the foundation seeks to raise awareness and foster conservation efforts in the La Cabaña community and beyond.     ",
