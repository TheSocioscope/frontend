  "description": "Landworks is a resettlement charity located in Totnes, England, dedicated to providing a pathway back into employment for individuals at risk of incarceration or those who have recently been released from prison. The initiative operates on a 2 to 3-acre site and focuses on creating a supportive environment where participants can develop hands-on skills, gain self-worth, and reintegrate into society.\n\nFounded by Chris, who initially aspired to be a farmer, Landworks emphasizes the importance of acceptance and community. The program fosters a safe space where individuals can work together, learn various trades such as gardening, pottery, and woodworking, and share meals, which is central to building relationships and trust. The initiative has successfully reintegrated over 250 individuals into society since its inception in 2017.\n\nLandworks operates on a model that prioritizes social rehabilitation over profit, relying on multiple funding sources, including the National Lottery and various charitable foundations. The organization also engages with the local community through open days and educational visits, aiming to change perceptions about ex-prisoners and promote understanding.",
