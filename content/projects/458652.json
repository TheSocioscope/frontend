  "description": "The Panc Ecuador initiative, founded by Nina Duarte, focuses on the conservation of agrobiodiversity through research and education on non-conventional food plants. Located in the Intijacta Reserve in the Andean Chocó, the initiative promotes knowledge management via guides, didactic materials, and experiential workshops. By engaging communities in sowing, harvesting, cooking, and processing these plants, Panc aims to enhance food sovereignty and diversify local diets, fostering a deeper connection to the environment.",
