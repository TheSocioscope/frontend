  "description": "Tacay focuses on transforming a family-owned business that originally engaged in cattle farming into a sustainable enterprise centered around the production of cosmetic oils and food products derived from the cacay nut and cocoa seeds. Over the past 16 years, the company has shifted its operations to promote the cultivation of these native trees, which were previously undervalued and often cut down. By educating local farmers on the benefits of cocoa cultivation and purchasing their produce, the initiative has not only revitalized the local economy but also contributed to environmental restoration, leading to increased biodiversity in the area. The company aims to expand its market reach, particularly in France, while exploring new food product lines, thereby enhancing the value of previously neglected resources and fostering a sustainable agricultural model in the region.",
