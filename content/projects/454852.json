  "description": "Projecte Sepia focuses on marine conservation, specifically addressing the decline of cuttlefish and squid populations crucial for local fishing and gastronomy. It involves collaboration between local fishermen and a marine biologist to create underwater structures for egg-laying, while also raising awareness about sustainable fishing practices. The project aims to educate the community, including schools and tourists, about the importance of preserving marine ecosystems. By engaging local stakeholders, it seeks to foster a sense of responsibility towards the environment and promote responsible consumption of seafood.",
