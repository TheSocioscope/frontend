Initially starting in 2016 with plastic collection, they now handle 15 different waste types. Operating mainly in Tbilisi, they offer an Eco Taxi service for individuals and companies to facilitate waste collection. Future plans include expanding the types of waste they collect based on the capabilities of recycling factories.     ",
