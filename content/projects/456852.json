  "description": "At Cereus Biotechnology we are inspired by the activity of naturally occurring microbes to remediate glyphosate contamination in the environment.  The correlation between the exponential increase in Parkinson’s disease, Non-Hodgkins lymphoma,  Autism, celiac disease and degenerative cartilage disease with the use of glyphosate warrant further investigation.  We believe the exposure  to this modified amino acid and its potential incorporation in all living systems can be reduced through the use of microorganisms in the soil and food supply.  ",
