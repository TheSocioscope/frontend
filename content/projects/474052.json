  "description": "Samwana Natural Foods is an initiative aimed at addressing food insecurity in Kenya by connecting smallholder farmers with consumers. Founded by a farmer who transitioned from selling fresh produce to creating value-added products, the business focuses on preserving indigenous foods. By processing items like cassava and mango into flour, ketchup, and dried snacks, Samwana ensures that farmers receive fair prices while reducing post-harvest losses. The initiative promotes sustainable practices and aims to formalize its operations for greater impact.",
