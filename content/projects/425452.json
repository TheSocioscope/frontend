  "description": "Urban agriculture and food systems are fast gaining the attention of planners and policy makers across the global south and north. A number of cities and regions are developing and implementing food systems plans and policies. While this emerging planning and policy attention is laudable, it must build on decades of community-led efforts to rebuild urban agriculture and community food systems. Failure to build on these on-the ground practices run the risk of developing policy that is uninformed and disconnected from the lived experiences of people in communities.\n\nThis Urban Agriculture Magazine explores the issue of community engagement in (urban) food policy and planning through case studies across the globe. A total of 17 articles explore the formal and informal role of community in urban food policy and planning, innovative planning practices and participatory policy development.",
