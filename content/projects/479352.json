  "description": "The initiative \"No Food Waste\" aims to combat food wastage by collecting excess food from events, institutions, and restaurants, redistributing it to those in need. Founded in 2014 in Coimbatore, it has expanded to multiple cities, including Chennai, where it operates a kitchen to prepare nutritious meals and provides grocery support. The organization emphasizes environmental sustainability and community engagement, striving to raise awareness about food waste and its impact on society.         ",
