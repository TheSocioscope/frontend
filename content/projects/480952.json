  "description": "Verdes Pensamientos, founded in 2012, is an initiative focused on food sustainability and sovereignty, primarily targeting vulnerable children in Quindío. Initially teaching urban gardening and nutrition, it has since evolved into a green enterprise, impacting over 40,000 children and expanding its services to support local farmers and businesses in regenerative agriculture. By 2021, it formalized as an incubator, providing consultancy and fostering sustainable practices across various sectors, while aiming for national expansion.",
