  "description": "The initiative at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral (UNL) focuses on producing fortified foods through a social food program that began in response to emergencies, such as the 2003 flooding in Santa Fe. The food plant aims to enhance nutrition for vulnerable populations by developing dehydrated, nutrient-rich products. It emphasizes education on food preparation and nutrition, collaborating with local communities to ensure the food meets their needs while promoting sustainable practices and food security.",
