  "description": "ACUAPONÍA EJE RAÍZ is a small-scale aquaponics project located in Santa Rosa de Cabal, Risaralda. It operates a water recirculation system that combines fish farming with plant cultivation, allowing for sustainable food production. Founded by an agronomist engineer, the initiative has a minimal organizational structure consisting of just three individuals, focusing on producing unique products such as basil pesto, lime pesto, and sweet pickled cucumbers. The founder has developed a more economical approach to aquaponics, utilizing recycled materials and experimenting with various crops. The initiative is committed to sharing knowledge and fostering a connection with the local community, emphasizing the importance of growing food without chemicals and promoting agroecology.",
