  "description": "The Montpellier Process is an initiative launched in 2015 to create cross-sectoral collaboration between international expert groups (HLPE, IPBES, IPCC) working on food systems, environment, and health. The project evolved to support national roadmaps for food system transformation following COP28's UAE declaration. It focuses on creating a learning community sharing case studies at local levels (Montpellier, São Paulo, Cali) and national levels (Mexico, Colombia, Vietnam, Switzerland, Cambodia), connecting different scales through transsectoral dialogue.",
