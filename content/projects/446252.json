  "description": "EDENN is a joint association focused on the protection and management of river ecosystems in the Anthèse region, particularly concerning the catchment area that feeds into Nantes via the Erdre and Loire rivers. Established in the late 1990s, the initiative evolved from coordinating various river uses, such as fishing and boating, to addressing environmental objectives, especially after becoming an administrative structure in 2018. The primary missions include ensuring the ecological health of water bodies in line with European directives, managing Natura 2000 sites for biodiversity protection, and coordinating recreational water uses.\n\nEDENN emphasizes collaboration with local farmers to reduce chemical inputs that pollute water sources, promoting sustainable agricultural practices. They aim to foster dialogue among various stakeholders, balancing ecological needs with economic interests, while navigating the complexities of environmental governance.",
