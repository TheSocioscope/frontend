  "description": "The initiative described is Finca Laguna Verde, a regenerative rotational dairy grazing and milking operation located in Costa Rica. The farm has been operational for about 50 years, with the current owner taking over approximately seven to eight years ago. Upon assuming responsibility, she transitioned the farm to regenerative practices, despite facing significant pushback from the local community and even her own family. The motivation behind this shift was primarily environmental, aiming to reduce contributions to climate change and restore the health of the land.\n\nThe farm operates with a small herd of around 60 cows, milking about 30 at any given time. Although the production of milk has decreased significantly—down to a quarter of previous levels—the owner has managed to maintain financial stability by reducing input costs associated with feed and medication, resulting in a marginally more profitable operation. The farm also generates additional income through accommodations and plans to diversify its produce and create value-added products in the future.",
