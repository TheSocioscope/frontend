  "description": "Food not war - Sofia is a self-organized initiative of volunteers, a local branch of the eponymous  international movement for ecosocial justice. It operates in the capital of Bulgaria. Adopting the slogans \"Food is a right, not a privilege\", and \"Solidarity, not charity|, it maintains a community urban garden and kitchen, where people of all walks of life are free to share work and a meal every Sunday. The organization's activities have been consistently focused on people in need and the shared kitchen and garden are meant as a space, where everyone can feel equal. The movement, which entirely depends of self-organizing volunteers, initiates mutual aid groups on specific problems. Its activists unite around causes, related to pacifism, non-violence and equal rights on representation in decision-making. ",
