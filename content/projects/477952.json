  "description": "Incuti Foods is a Rwandan youth-led company focused on chili pepper processing. Founded by two co-founders with backgrounds in food science, the initiative addresses post-harvest losses by sourcing chilies directly from local farmers, particularly women. They emphasize sustainability by using locally sourced materials and minimizing food waste. With a vision to become a leading hot sauce producer in Africa, they aim to expand their product range and market presence while supporting local agriculture.",
