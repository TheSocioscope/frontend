  "description": "Zitouna Life is an agroecology farm located around 60 kilometers from Rabat, in a semi-arid region. The 4-hectare farm was founded in 2020, and stands out for its commitment to promoting sustainable, environmentally-friendly farming practices, notably through the raising of chickens and the cultivation of carob and fig trees. The farm uses water optimization techniques to cope with climatic challenges and drought, while creating a green space in the midst of a degraded environment. In addition to its farming activities, the farm is active on social networks, raising public awareness of ecological practices and sharing advice on agroecology.",
