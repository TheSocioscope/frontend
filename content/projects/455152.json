  "description": "The initiative focuses on creating urban gardens in Bogotá, aiming to promote agroecology and environmental sustainability. Founded by two brothers with backgrounds in architecture and industrial design, it evolved from a previous landscaping business that faced challenges. The project emphasizes community impact, hiring ex-combatants to foster social inclusion. With two successful gardens, they prioritize local sales and minimal emissions, collaborating with restaurants and educational institutions. Their vision has shifted from purely commercial to a commitment to environmental and social responsibility, positioning them as pioneers in urban agriculture.",
