  "description": "The initiative, \"Les Pieds dans le Plat\" was founded by a group of chefs and cooks in response to the Grenelle Environment Forum. The collective aims to transform food practices in collective catering by promoting 100% organic, homemade meals using local and seasonal produce. Key activities include training and supporting kitchen teams in various institutions, such as schools and retirement homes, to implement these practices effectively. The initiative emphasizes collaboration with local organic farming groups, public authorities, and other food-related organizations to create a network that supports food self-sufficiency and combats malnutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations like the elderly.
