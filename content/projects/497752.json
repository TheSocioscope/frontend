  "description": "The initiative aims to empower the Yahweh, a native Amazonian people, by recovering their cultural identity through food. Collaborating with Biokusharo and led by nutritionist Carol Zabaleta, the project focuses on preserving native cultivars, particularly Shawi roots and tubers, while addressing nutritional deficiencies. By creating a catalogue of these products, the initiative seeks to market them, ensuring economic sustainability and visibility for the community, ultimately enhancing their quality of life.",
