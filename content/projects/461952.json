  "description": "The initiative aims to create a sustainable food system in Copenhagen by connecting local farmers directly with consumers. Inspired by experiences at Lille Bakery and the Grandmago market, the intitiative established a non-profit shop that prioritizes fresh, organic produce from small farms. The project seeks to educate the community about the importance of supporting local agriculture while making high-quality, sustainably grown food accessible to everyone, fostering a sense of community and environmental responsibility.",
