  "description": "The Te Kakano project is primarily about habitat restoration and community engagement in New Zealand. It was initiated around 16 years ago with the goal of reintroducing native plants and restoring ecosystems that have been altered or damaged over time. The project emphasizes the importance of connecting the local community with their environment by involving them in hands-on activities such as planting and caring for native plants. The initiative also focuses on eco-sourcing, using locally sourced seeds to ensure that the plants are well adapted to the local climate and ecosystem. Through education programs and volunteer opportunities, Te Kakano aims to foster a sense of ownership and stewardship among community members, ultimately contributing to the preservation of New Zealand's unique flora and fauna.",
