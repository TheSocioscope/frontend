  "description": "Santa Anita Estate Coffee is a family-run coffee producer in Costa Rica, focusing on high-quality coffee through sustainable practices. While not fully organic, they implement regenerative methods, such as efficient irrigation and soil biodiversity enhancement. The estate prioritizes quality over quantity, producing specialty coffee primarily for export. They aim to reduce their environmental impact while maintaining commercial viability, and they are exploring further value addition by potentially roasting their own coffee in the future.",
