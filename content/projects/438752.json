  "description": "Alvanovo Organic Orchards is an association of agricultural producers dedicated to the cultivation of pure, ecologically grown and processed fruits and nuts. The orchards of Alvanovo are certified for organic farming and are taken care of in accordance with the extant nature-friendly guidelines and standards. The orchards spread over 192 acres, occupying the land of the old vineyards of Alvanovo, a village in north-east Bulgaria. The fruit and nuts are harvested manually with the seasonal help of the residents of the nearby village of Dulgach. The Orchards produce plum and walnut jams, dried fruit, nuts and essential oils.  The oils, which are extracted from the pits of the organic plums without being subjected to thermal processing, are then used for the production of boutique cosmetic products. The company also makes the traditional pistil - a dried fruit paste from plums with no added sugars, considered a traditional delicacy in Bulgaria.",
