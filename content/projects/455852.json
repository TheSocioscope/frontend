  "description": "This initiative focuses on transforming coffee by-products into an ecological energy source through the production of pellets. The project aims to address environmental concerns by utilizing waste materials that would otherwise contribute to pollution. The process is designed to be sustainable, incorporating eco-friendly packaging and recycling practices. The founder, a young biologist, was inspired by the need to reduce waste in the coffee industry and has successfully established a business model that not only promotes environmental responsibility but also creates economic opportunities through exports and potential franchising.",
