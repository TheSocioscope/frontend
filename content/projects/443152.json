  "description": "The Foresta pedagogical farm is located in the park of the same name in the 15th district of Marseille. \n\nThe farm is managed by the association Dihya, a very active player in the fight against poverty and hunger, particularly in the northern districts of the city. The farm has more than 50 animals (cows, sheep, goats, ducks, chickens, rabbits, hens, gooses), all of which were donated by sympathetic organisations and farmers. The management of the farm itself relies on donations and support from a solidarity network in which it is embedded.\n\nThe farm is open to all kinds of visitors, and especially to children. Access is free.\n",
