  "description": "The initiative, founded in 1974, began as a social project by a religious community aimed at creating an inclusive space for people with disabilities. Relocating from Barcelona to rural Catalonia, the project fostered community life and work, integrating individuals often marginalized by society. Over the years, it evolved into a cooperative focused on sustainable agriculture, producing wine and olive oil while promoting social inclusion and providing meaningful employment opportunities for its members.",
