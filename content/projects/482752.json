  "description": "The Chandrika initiative focuses on producing fortified gelatine using tropical fruits native to Peru, aiming to enhance food security and nutrition. Founded by a family business, it transitioned from traditional gelatine to healthier options, driven by a personal motivation to address health issues like diabetes. The project emphasizes sustainability, innovation, and collaboration with local fruit producers, while also seeking to expand its market presence, particularly in Lima, to reach a broader audience.",
