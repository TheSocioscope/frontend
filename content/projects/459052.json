  "description": "Paccari is an Ecuadorian chocolate brand committed to sustainability, organic practices, and fair trade. Founded 23 years ago, it aims to revitalize the planet by supporting small-scale farmers and transforming fine aroma cocoa into premium chocolate. Paccari's philosophy is rooted in a triple impact model—economic, social, and environmental—ensuring that their practices benefit farmers, consumers, and the planet. The company is dedicated to organic farming, requiring farmers to avoid chemicals for three years to achieve organic certification, which can initially reduce yields but ultimately supports long-term sustainability. Paccari has become a benchmark in the industry, emphasizing the importance of conscious consumerism and the intrinsic relationship between humans and nature.",
