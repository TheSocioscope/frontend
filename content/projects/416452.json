  "description": "Restorestje, Ghent, Belgium\nLess food waste with the Restorestje: a handy box to take home the surplus food after a restaurant visit.\nGhent was the first Belgian city to launch the 'Restorestje' initiative: a free, compostable box for restaurant leftovers. In five years , no less than 71,000 boxes were handed out by 180 participating restaurants in Ghent. The concept of the Restorestje emerged from a citizens' consultation and was later approved by the City of Ghent, Belgium.\nhttps://stad.gent/en/city-governance-organisation/city-policy/ghents-climate-actions/sustainable-food#95295\n",
