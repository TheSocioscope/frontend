  "description": "Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke operates under a larger organization known as Action Aid, established in 1949 to promote collaboration and fairness in society, particularly for marginalized groups. The initiative focuses on community engagement through a café and various volunteer-led projects in Aarhus, Denmark. The café, which started in 2014, is vegan and affordable, serving as a gathering space for volunteers and the community.\n\nThe initiative aims to transform the food system by engaging young people aged 15 to 30 in sustainable food practices. This is part of a broader EU-funded project that encourages community involvement and aims to create tangible changes in the local food landscape. The organization relies heavily on volunteers, who come from diverse backgrounds, including those with farming experience, and fosters a sense of community and belonging among them.",
