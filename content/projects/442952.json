  "description": "Meryama is a farm focusing on agroecology and agrotourism, located close to major Moroccan cities. The farm, which has been relaunched after a period of inactivity, focuses on the cultivation of endemic and water-efficient plants, in response to the challenges of water stress in the region. At the same time, it aims to offer a sustainable tourism experience, incorporating environmentally-friendly practices such as phytodepuration systems and a biological swimming pool. Although the agrotourism project is not yet operational, infrastructures such as inns and a restaurant are under development, with a planned opening in early 2025. The initiative is part of a wider network of farmers committed to agroecology, seeking to promote sustainable farming methods and establish connections between players in the sector.",
