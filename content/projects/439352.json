  "description": "The aim of this mission was to observe the operation and functioning of an aquaponic farm in the Czech Republic, visit it and interview its founders, who are trying to find sustainable and ecological ways of producing food, such as vegetables, herbs and fish. Their objective is to achieve total independence and create a circular model and ecosystem, a complete symbiosis between fish and plants, providing each other with nutrients and clean, filtered water. \nUsing observation and interview methods, we were able to understand the steadily growing market of aquaponic farms in the Czech Republic, the importance of these concepts and their impact on the socio-economic accessibility of the Czech society to fresh fish and vegetables throughout the year in a country that has no access to the sea or larger bodies of water and has four seasons with winter, making Czech society dependent on importing products from abroad. This initiative proves that it is possible to approach fish and vegetable farming responsibly while saving energy, water, our ecosystem while supporting the local market and economy.",
