  "description": "The Robin Hood Army is a zero-funds volunteer organization founded in India in 2014, aiming to combat hunger by redistributing excess food from restaurants and bakeries to those in need. Since its inception in Sri Lanka in 2016, the organization has distributed over 2.2 million meals. Partnerships with local businesses, like bakeries and solar companies, help facilitate food drives, while volunteers play a crucial role in operations. The initiative promotes community engagement and aims to expand its reach to more cities and underprivileged areas.",
