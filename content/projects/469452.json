Established over 25 years ago, it addresses waste management in Boyacá by processing 17 tonnes of organic waste weekly. The initiative not only promotes sustainable practices but also engages local schools in educational programs about waste management. Additionally, Tierra Viva exports beetles, primarily for use as pets, further diversifying its impact and outreach.",
