  "description": "Comproagro is an innovative initiative founded to connect farmers directly with consumers, addressing the challenges faced by agricultural producers in Colombia. Launched in 2014, it began as a platform to sell onions and potatoes online, evolving into a social enterprise that now supports over 50,000 farmers nationwide. By eliminating intermediaries, Comproagro enhances farmers' earnings and promotes local produce, while also providing added value through processing and packaging.              ",
