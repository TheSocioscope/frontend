  "description": "The initiative is an association focused on combating food waste through a canning facility that repurposes unsold or \"ugly\" fruits and vegetables into jams. Established five years ago, it aims to create a community dedicated to reducing waste in Strasbourg. In addition to producing jams, the association offers training and awareness programs, fostering collective intelligence and collaboration among various stakeholders to drive systemic change in food consumption and waste management.
