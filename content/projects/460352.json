  "description": "The initiative focuses on the innovative reuse of industrial effluents through a biorefinery model in Mendoza, Argentina. With a dedicated area of 100 hectares, over 110,000 Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees have been planted to absorb liquid waste, transforming it into valuable biofertilizers. This pioneering approach, developed in collaboration with local universities, addresses environmental challenges while promoting sustainability in the wine industry and beyond, showcasing a commitment to circular economy practices.",
