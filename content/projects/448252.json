  "description": "Nordic Harvest is a vertical farming initiative located on the outskirts of Copenhagen. The initiative aims to address the significant environmental challenges posed by traditional farming methods, particularly the deforestation and climate issues resulting from conventional agricultural practices. \n\nThe mission of Nordic Harvest is to grow more food on less space, utilizing innovative technologies such as LED lighting and a controlled environment to maximize crop yields. The farm operates on a proof of concept model, currently producing crops like lettuce, herbs, and kale in a facility that spans 3,500 square meters, with plans to expand to 66,000 square meters, which would allow for the production of 1,000 tonnes of produce annually.\n\nNordic Harvest emphasizes research and development, employing a team of experts, including PhD holders and specialists in microbiology and sustainable agriculture, to ensure optimal growing conditions and to innovate in crop production.\n",
