  "description": "AMACA is an organization that creates agricultural projects on rented land, involving around 200 farmers across areas ranging from 500 to 5,000 hectares. These projects, with an investment of approximately 1 million USD, are funded through private, public, and credit investments. A key aspect of their projects is selling products before planting them, which ensures market demand and reduces losses. Through staggered planting schedules and technical assistance, AMACA guarantees the quality, quantity, price, and sustainability of crops, benefiting both farmers and the overall food supply while reducing hunger.",
