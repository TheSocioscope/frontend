The initiative aims to educate communities about the importance of good bacteria for gut health, encouraging the cultivation and use of kefir in households. The initiative operates primarily as a family business, promoting kefir through collaboration with local communities, nutritionists, and hotels. By providing training and resources, Kefir Kenya seeks to improve nutrition and health, fostering sustainable practices within the food system.",
