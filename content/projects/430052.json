  "description": "The company Flenexa has created an aquaponic farm already in 2011 and established the name and their business on the market in 2017. Using the methods of interview and observation, we tried to understand the functioning of the aquaponic farm on the East of Czech Republic while trying to understand the challanges the modern and sustainable farming has to deal with. The method of aquaponics, where farmers breed fish and grow vegetables and herbs in a symbiosis, one ecosystem, has proven itself to be a possible sustainable way of modern agriculture that supports local market, local farmers and circular economy as well as ecological ways of farming. It also allows countries with no direct access to sea or countries with changing seasons to produce vegetables and fish all year long, independently of the outside temperature and weather.",
