  "description": "Villa Claudia Farm is a sustainable agribusiness located on the outskirts of Pereira, which integrates environmental stewardship with agricultural production and tourism. The farm is managed by a family that emphasizes animal welfare and sustainable practices, leveraging technical expertise in zootechnics and molecular microbiology to enhance productivity and ecological balance. They produce a variety of goods, including milk, coffee, eggs, and cheese, while also offering immersive tourism experiences such as coffee tours and gastronomic events that educate visitors about sustainable practices. The farm has achieved several certifications for good practices and sustainability, and it aims to establish a unique identity for its products, particularly coffee and cheese, within the region. Despite facing challenges in marketing and the impacts of climate change, the initiative aspires to be a reference point for agro-sustainability and to foster a deeper connection between consumers and the agricultural processes that sustain them",
