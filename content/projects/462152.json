  "description": "Lille Bakery is a community-focused initiative founded in 2018. It aims to provide nourishing, locally-sourced food at affordable prices, moving away from the fine dining model. The bakery fosters connections with local farmers and producers, emphasizing transparency and sustainability. By creating a welcoming space for the community, Lille Bakery not only serves delicious baked goods, offering breakfast and lunch, but also hosts workshops and events, enriching the local food culture in a tourist-heavy area.",
