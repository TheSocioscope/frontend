  "description": "The aquaponic farm Aquaponia has stabilized its presence on the market in 2018. Using the methods of interview and observation, we tried to understand the functioning of the aquaponic farm, that is positioned strategically to covered the demand on the South and in the Center of the Czech Republic, including its proximity to the capital, Prague. We tried to understand the challanges the modern and sustainable farming has to deal with. The method of aquaponics, where farmers breed fish and grow vegetables and herbs in a symbiosis, one ecosystem, has proven itself to be a possible sustainable way of modern agriculture that supports local market, local farmers and circular economy as well as ecological ways of farming. It also allows countries with no direct access to sea or countries with changing seasons to produce vegetables and fish all year long, independently of the outside temperature and weather.",
