  "description": "The initiative focuses on creating a sustainable urban agriculture model through hydroponic greenhouses at the Santana school. Originating from a high school thesis on vertical gardens, it aims to engage students in food production while promoting organic, pesticide-free produce. The project collaborates with local restaurants and educational institutions, fostering community involvement and environmental awareness. By integrating education and agriculture, it seeks to enhance food quality and sustainability in urban settings.",
