  "description": "The Janus Integrating Rural Project, initiated by two agronomists, aims to revitalize abandoned agricultural land in the Alto Valle de Río Negro, Neuquén. Established in 2009, the project focuses on biodynamic and agroecological practices to produce healthy food while promoting rural living. By fostering community-supported agriculture (CSA), Janus connects urban consumers with local farmers, encouraging sustainable practices and enhancing the relationship between cities and the countryside.
