  "description": "Kitchen. Table. is a multi-media research on the movement of food-making practices through migration and trade. It is a project that tells the fantastically rich and intricate (his)stories connected to the culinary landscapes of the regions we live in, and how these have developed over time. Questions on food memory, and the influence of migrations which have contributed to the spread different food cultures around the world, and the labour of love in the kitchen in a post-capitalist society, as well as the unaccounted stories of more than human beings are all central ideas from which this project develops. \nSamah presents her work in a variety of artistic forms, mainly in the form of performative food encounters over a meal with an audience of 40-60 persons. She also presents live video performance and creates food map posters of her research. In 2023 she will launch a podcast that explores artistic research around food.\n",
