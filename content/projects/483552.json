  "description": "MyFood is an innovative initiative launched in 2015 by three co-founders aiming to enhance food autonomy for individuals. Recognizing the limitations of conventional supermarkets, they developed connected vertical greenhouses utilizing aquaponics to enable households to grow their own nutritious food. This project not only addresses nutritional quality and environmental concerns but also fosters a supportive community among users, promoting self-sufficiency and sustainable practices in food production.",
