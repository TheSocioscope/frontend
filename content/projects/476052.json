  "description": "The SERM Smart Farm Kenya initiative, led by a youth entrepreneur, focuses on cultivating local indigenous vegetables to address unemployment and promote sustainable farming. By training local youth, particularly those struggling with drug use, the project fosters economic empowerment through organic farming. The farm operates on family land and collaborates with various stakeholders, including schools and local businesses, to create a self-sustaining model that not only provides fresh produce but also rehabilitates the community.",
