  "description": "Loop Frome focuses on managing organic waste from local restaurants through an innovative subscription model. Utilizing electric bikes, the team collects food waste, composts it, and redistributes the resulting compost to community projects or sells it. Originating from a community-driven program aimed at fostering sustainability, it emphasizes circular principles and local engagement. The initiative operates on a small scale, relying on a close-knit team and community support, while also attracting interest from other towns looking to replicate its model. Its future growth may involve expanding services to include additional materials.",
