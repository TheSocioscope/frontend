  "description": "The initiative, CCORI, focuses on promoting sustainable gastronomy by educating individuals and communities on the principles of optimal cooking. This methodology emphasizes the maximum utilization of food ingredients, advocating for conservation, culinary recycling, and the innovative use of all parts of food to minimize waste. The initiative aims to transform perceptions about food, particularly parts that are often discarded, by demonstrating their culinary potential and nutritional value. CCORI collaborates with various stakeholders, including academic institutions, scientific research centers, and private companies, to implement training programs for cooks in soup kitchens and other food service environments. These programs not only teach sustainable cooking practices but also aim to improve economic outcomes for participants by reducing food costs through better ingredient utilization.",
