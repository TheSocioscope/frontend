  "description": "The Friese Aromatizate initiative focuses on empowering women with disabilities through agroecological practices and education. Originating in Bogotá with urban vegetable gardens, it transitioned to rural areas during the pandemic. Participants engage in activities like planting and harvesting aromatic herbs, fostering autonomy and community interaction. The program emphasizes inclusivity, providing a supportive environment where women can develop skills, gain economic independence, and challenge societal perceptions of disability.",
