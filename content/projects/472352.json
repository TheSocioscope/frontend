  "description": "Verdcamp Fruits is a five-generation family business located near Tarragona, Spain, specializing in regenerative agriculture. With around 300 hectares, they have transitioned from conventional to ecological and now regenerative farming practices. Their innovative techniques, such as floral intercropping and minimal tillage, promote biodiversity and soil health. Despite producing high-quality organic vegetables, they face challenges in market valuation and pricing, striving to educate consumers about the benefits of their sustainable practices.",
