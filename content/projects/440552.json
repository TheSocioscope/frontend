  "description": "Amaca Grande is part of the broader Campo Digno de la Esquiamaca project, which aims to develop and promote rural projects in Colombia through three interconnected axes. Amaca Grande focuses on creating agricultural business opportunities by organizing peasant associations of producers, typically targeting around 200 families to ensure sufficient negotiating power with clients. The initiative emphasizes agricultural planning and technical assistance, utilizing innovative methods such as remote support via WhatsApp to enhance productivity and sustainability. By leveraging existing infrastructure and forming pre-purchase agreements with buyers, Amaca Grande seeks to secure financing through collective loans and government support, ultimately aiming to empower rural communities and foster long-term development in the agricultural sector.",
