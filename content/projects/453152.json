  "description": "The initiative focuses on promoting sustainable agriculture through the establishment of a participatory seed bank and the implementation of innovative agro-ecological practices. Originating from a farm that has transitioned from conventional to organic farming over the past few years, the project aims to enhance resilience against climate change and improve access to diverse seeds for local farmers. By leveraging a cooperative model, the initiative seeks to pool resources and products from various farmers, addressing the lack of a permanent market for organic produce in the region. Additionally, the project emphasizes collaboration with international organizations and local stakeholders to develop a network that supports the growth of resilient plant varieties and sustainable farming techniques, ultimately benefiting the agricultural community and fostering environmental stewardship.",
