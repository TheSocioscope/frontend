  "description": "Ferme Facyla is a farm-school located in Sidi Ahia, around 80 kilometers from Rabat, which was founded in 2010. Over the years, the farm has experimented with various agroecology and agroforestry techniques, and in 2022 was transformed into a farm-school to share its knowledge with other farmers in Morocco. The farm stands out for its profitability, having generated income in its first three years, and for its innovative approach which includes training and support for farmers, as well as a strong connection with agricultural institutions. In addition to growing a wide variety of vegetables, fruit and medicinal plants, the farm implements sustainable practices to create a balanced ecosystem, while developing a training center to host trainees and students interested in agroecology.",
