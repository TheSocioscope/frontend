  "description": "The Evands initiative focuses on combating anaemia, particularly in low-income areas like Tingo María, where rates are alarmingly high. With a founder who was inspired by her personal health challenges, the initiative produces nutritious chocolates and porridges enriched with haemoglobin powder. By collaborating with local municipalities, the initiative aims to provide these products free of charge to affected families, while also promoting dietary education and sustainable food practices.
