With a founder who was inspired by her personal health challenges, the initiative produces nutritious chocolates and porridges enriched with haemoglobin powder. By collaborating with local municipalities, the initiative aims to provide these products free of charge to affected families, while also promoting dietary education and sustainable food practices.
