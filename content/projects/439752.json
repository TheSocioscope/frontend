  "description": "Most of Singapore's foods are imported. Supply chain disruptions during the global pandemic has demonstrated the criticality of food security for the country. With that in mind, the country has aims to achieve \"30 by 30\" – to build national capabilities for the sustainable production of foods to meet 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by the year 2030. Several initiatives have taken place since this goal was announced, such as the land planning to develop sites for urban farms. This project will focus on the perspectives of a commercial entity that is in the business of promoting urban farming at home – to understand the on-ground opportunities, gaps and challenges in driving consumer demand for urban farming in Singapore. In undertaking this study, we hope to be able to understand the urban farming landscape, as well as what \"30 by 30\" means for non-governmental stakeholders in Singapore.",
