  "description": "SlowFood Educa is an initiative aimed at enhancing food and environmental education in schools. Born from the experiences of a psychologist during the COVID-19 pandemic, it addresses the rising issues of eating disorders and poor nutrition among children. The program connects schools with local farmers and chefs, promoting sustainable practices and seasonal produce. By fostering intergenerational exchanges and hands-on learning, SlowFood Educa empowers students to appreciate quality food and its origins, ultimately aiming to create healthier communities.",
