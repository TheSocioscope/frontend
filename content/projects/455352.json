  "description": "The initiative focuses on waste management, particularly recycling and composting, to address environmental challenges. It began with an environmental engineer who sought to improve recycling processes but shifted to composting due to difficulties with independent waste pickers. Collaborating with a waste collection company, the project established a composting facility that utilizes air circulation to accelerate decomposition. The initiative aims to enhance organic waste management while providing work opportunities for local youth. Despite facing financial sustainability challenges, it continues to evolve and explore innovative composting methods for greater efficiency and impact.",
