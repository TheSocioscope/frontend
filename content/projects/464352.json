  "description": "The initiative, Foodshare Copenhagen, aims to combat food waste by redistributing surplus food to individuals and families in need. Founded in 2018, it operates through volunteer efforts, collecting food from supermarkets and bakeries, and distributing it at community events. The organization fosters a sense of community among environmentalists and promotes sustainability, encouraging participants to share food rather than waste it. Its mission emphasizes education and collaboration to create a more sustainable food system.",
