  "description": "The initiative focuses on biological pest control using insects, addressing a market need in Colombia due to regulations against chemical fumigation in sugar mills. A group of students began cultivating insects for sustainable agricultural practices, leading to the establishment of a well-organized company. They research various parasitic insects to combat specific pests and have developed a cricket protein flour, promoting awareness of insect consumption. Despite challenges like dependency on sugar mills and environmental factors, they aim to diversify their offerings and enhance operational processes for future growth.",
