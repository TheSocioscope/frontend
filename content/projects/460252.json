  "description": "Almacén Andante, founded in 2008-2009 in Guaymayén, Mendoza, is a project dedicated to marketing and distributing products from small producers, cooperatives, and social organizations. Initially starting as a stand at the National University of Cuyo, it has evolved into a walking warehouse that emphasizes fair trade, food sovereignty, and responsible consumption. The initiative fosters local consumption and sustainability while providing a platform for marginalized producers to reach consumers directly.",
