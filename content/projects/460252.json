Initially starting as a stand at the National University of Cuyo, it has evolved into a walking warehouse that emphasizes fair trade, food sovereignty, and responsible consumption. The initiative fosters local consumption and sustainability while providing a platform for marginalized producers to reach consumers directly.",
