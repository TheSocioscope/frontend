  "description": "The initiative, known as Domestic, began in 2015 to promote local Danish cuisine through a fine dining experience. Founded by three co-owners, it emphasizes customer experience and sustainability, focusing on local produce. After facing challenges post-COVID, the sole owner, Christopher, has fostered collaborations with local farmers and other restaurants to enhance sustainability practices. The restaurant aims for a regenerative food system while prioritizing community and innovative approaches to dining.",
