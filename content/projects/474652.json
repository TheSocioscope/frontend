The initiative aims to empower these communities, particularly young people, by sharing knowledge and practical solutions that enhance climate resilience and improve income. Wangechi Kuria emphasizes the importance of accessible information, addressing the gaps in understanding agricultural practices and sustainability concepts.  The initiative seeks to create a global impact, particularly in the Global South, by fostering conversations around food systems and encouraging communities to leverage their existing resources for sustainable development.",
