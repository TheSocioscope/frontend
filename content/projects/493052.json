  "description": "The initiative, Cocina Optimista, focuses on developing programs like \"Kind Kitchens\" and \"Optimal Cooking\" to enhance food education and reduce waste in culinary practices. Originating in 2015, the initiative aims to empower communities, including those in prisons, by teaching efficient cooking techniques that utilize all parts of ingredients. This approach not only promotes better nutrition but also fosters optimism and skills among participants, ultimately contributing to social change.      ",
