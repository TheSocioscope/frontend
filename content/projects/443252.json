  "description": "GreenLab is the green industrial park of the future for companies that want to contribute to the green transition.\nHere, sustainable energy is generated and supplied to the park’s companies (soon) via a direct connection, and the companies in the park can share their surplus energy and resources with each other through the SymbiosisNet™ - an intelligent network of energy and data. The GreenLab model demonstrates how different energy sectors can be integrated in a unique interplay between green hydrogen, industry, and energy infrastructure.\n\nhttps://www.greenlab.dk/\n",
