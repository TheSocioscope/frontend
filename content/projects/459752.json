Founded by a team of agronomists, the project aims to convert organic waste into biochar, improving carbon capture and soil fertility. They collaborate with local farmers and municipalities, providing training and equipment while promoting sustainable practices. Their goal is to address soil degradation and contribute to carbon footprint reduction, ultimately benefiting both the environment and local communities.",
