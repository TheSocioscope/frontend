  "description": "The Raices Piangueras, founded in 2019, empowers over 11,000 women in Buenaventura, Colombia, to preserve mangrove ecosystems and the piangua mollusk. This initiative focuses on environmental conservation, education, and sustainable economic practices, enabling women to lead in decision-making processes traditionally dominated by men. Through training and community engagement, the organization promotes the cultural and gastronomic significance of the piangua, fostering both environmental sustainability and women's economic independence.",
