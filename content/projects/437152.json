  "description": "Conca d'Oro is a cooperative farm divided in two fields: social and work inclusion, housing and day care for people with disabilities and autism, and production of organic food. Its production fields are: cultivation of vegetables and fruits on open fields and greenhouses, a grocery shop with own products and gift packs made by the apprentices, a restaurant, a bakery. \n\nThe workers are social and agriculture operators and their first mission is the well being of their apprentices. The apprentices are taught organic farming, baking, cooking and work as waiters for the restaurant, and packaging of gift packs. Customers can have lunch and dinner at the restaurant and buy at the grocery shop self produced, seasonal products and gift packs, according to the time of the year. Their products are available also online and twice a week at the local market of Bassano del Grappa. \n\nConca d'Oro is one of the first examples of social, organic farm in the area and a reference point for the local community in terms of quality of the products and reputation of its social purpose. They organise regularly events, in order to make themselves know better. ",
