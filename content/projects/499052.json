  "description": "Let's Food is an association dedicated to supporting local authorities in France and abroad in developing sustainable, resilient, and equitable food policies. The initiative focuses on three main areas: assisting local authorities, creating a resource center for innovative food initiatives, and providing training for students and local elected officials in sustainable agriculture and food issues. The initiative aims to create frameworks for action that facilitate the food transition by enabling local authorities to activate various levers, such as funding and partnerships, to implement effective public policies. Let's Food also emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, working with various ministries and sectors to address the complexities of food systems.",
