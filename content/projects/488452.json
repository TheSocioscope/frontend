  "description": "Oda is a restaurant initiative that aims to celebrate the agricultural richness of Colombia, particularly focusing on the Andean region's diverse production of fruits and vegetables. The restaurant is part of The Next Shot group, which also includes an indoor golf club and a cocktail lounge. Since its inception nearly four years ago, Oda has sought to create a fine dining experience that highlights local ingredients and culinary traditions while promoting sustainability. The restaurant collaborates with local producers, viewing them as allies rather than mere suppliers, and has established a rigorous evaluation system to assess potential partners based on sustainability criteria.",
