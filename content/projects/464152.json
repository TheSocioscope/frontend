  "description": "The Ecas initiative, established 12 years ago, aims to connect local farmers with consumers in Greater Buenos Aires, providing affordable, healthy produce. It began with a small group transporting vegetables to a neighborhood fair and has evolved into a cooperative that supports local producers while ensuring fair pricing for consumers. Ecas focuses on strengthening the agricultural sector, promoting agroecological practices, and creating sustainable livelihoods for both farmers and community members.",
