  "description": "Ferme Mama Ghaia is a permaculture farm spanning just over 5 hectares. It employs innovative techniques to cultivate a diverse range of over a hundred varieties of fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants. The project, which has been operational for four years, initially focused on soil improvement before transitioning to profitable production. The farm aims to create a holistic lifestyle experience, integrating organic farming with wellness activities such as yoga and spirituality sessions, thereby attracting visitors and promoting sustainable practices. The initiative also emphasizes community engagement by employing local seasonal workers and educating them on permaculture principles, fostering a deeper understanding of sustainable agriculture within the neighborhood.",
