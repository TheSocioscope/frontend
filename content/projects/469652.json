  "description": "Fish and Farm Cooperative was established in 2001 to support local fishermen in marketing their catch. Despite challenges, including a devastating hurricane in 2020 that damaged infrastructure and reduced membership from over 100 to about 45, the cooperative has made strides in rebuilding and maintaining operations. The initiative emphasizes the importance of community support, responsible fishing practices, and the need for increased production to meet demand. The cooperative also seeks to engage younger generations in fishing and has established partnerships with organizations like the UN for support.",
