  "description": "The Mucilago Atomizado de Sanky initiative focuses on the extraction and processing of mucilage from the sanky fruit, a lesser-known fruit from the Ayacucho region of Peru. Developed by a multidisciplinary team at the Catholic University, the project aims to highlight the fruit's nutritional value and potential as a natural thickener for food products. Launched in 2014 with funding from Prociencia, it seeks to promote sustainable agro-industrial practices while addressing the underutilization of local resources.",
