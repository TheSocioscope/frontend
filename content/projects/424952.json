  "description": "A growing number of cities and regions are forming Food Policy Councils (FPCs) and similar groups known by other names, such as multi-stakeholder food forums/platforms, food policy networks, food boards, food coalitions, food partnerships, and food labs.\n\nAs the movement towards inclusive, multi-stakeholder food systems governance for cities and city regions gathers momentum, there is a pressing need to document and systematise experiences of city food systems governance from around the world.\n\nIn this issue of the UA Magazine, we explore the experiences of FPCs and similar entities, on their approach to inclusiveness, documented impacts, and challenges faced.",
