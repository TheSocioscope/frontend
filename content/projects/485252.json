  "description": "Granja Tarapacá, initiated by the Hantarapacá Foundation in 2009, focuses on social agriculture to enhance therapeutic processes through productive agricultural practices. Founded in Palmira and later moved to Cali, the initiative adapts urban agriculture to support individuals with disabilities and promote food sovereignty. The foundation also collaborates with indigenous communities in the Matabén jungle, emphasizing sustainable practices and community empowerment through education and hands-on agricultural training.",
