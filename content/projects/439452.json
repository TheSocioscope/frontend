  "description": "Using observation and interview methods, we were able to understand the steadily growing market of aquaponic farms in the Czech Republic while looking at one of the aquaponic farms on the Czech market. We understood the importance of the concepts of sustainable farming using aquaponic methods and its positive future impact on the socio-economic accessibility of the Czech society to fresh fish and vegetables throughout the whole year in a country that has no access to the sea or larger bodies of water and has four seasons with winter, making Czech society dependent on importing products from abroad. This initiative proves that it is possible to approach fish and vegetable farming responsibly while saving energy, water, our ecosystem while supporting the local market and economy.",
