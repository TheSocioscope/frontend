It emphasizes the importance of environmental sustainability by utilizing organic farming methods and promoting the use of safe fertilizers. The initiative also seeks to create a collective brand that represents the quality of their coffee, allowing members to market their products more effectively while encouraging individual branding efforts. Overall, the association strives to improve the quality of life for its members by providing them with the tools and knowledge necessary for economic independence and social empowerment.",
