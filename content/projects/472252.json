Originating from a social laboratory, it focuses on collaboration between local actors, including health and food professionals, to foster behavioral change. By activating community food referents and providing training, the project seeks to enhance awareness and practices around nutrition, ultimately improving the overall health and well-being of the neighborhoods involved.",
