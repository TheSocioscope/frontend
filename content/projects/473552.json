Eco Scapes combines organic vegetable production with wildlife conservation, operating on 150 acres, of which 20 are under organic cultivation. The farm aims to provide healthy food for local families while addressing environmental issues related to pesticide use and climate change.  The initiative also serves as a demonstration farm, showcasing diverse crops and offering educational opportunities to the community about organic farming and conservation efforts.",
