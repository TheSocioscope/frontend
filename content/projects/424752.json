  "description": "The new issue of the Urban Agriculture Magazine analyses five key work areas for the coming decade: Resilience, Social inclusion, Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture, Urban Planning, and Governance.\n- Resilience\n Food systems around the globe are highly vulnerable to the impacts of multiple hazards, including climate shocks, natural events, global warming, and political instability. People, assets and infrastructures are vulnerable throughout food supply chains, from production to consumption and waste management, and the natural resources and ecosystem services on which they depend. This section reflects on the concept of resilience and vulnerabilities of food systems, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It looks into the experiences from the ground in Antananarivo, Quito, Melbourne and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, drawing some conclusions on the need for sustained, ambitious, and expanded efforts to build urban and city region food system resilience.\n- Social Inclusion\n Social inclusion is the process of improving the opportunities and ability for participation of disadvantaged individuals and groups in society, and improving the terms of engagement. This section discusses the right to food, justice and interventions on inclusion and enhancing agency. It looks at the informal sector and the need to properly understand and collaborate with the food system of the majority. It explores recent and ongoing work to put citizens at the centre of food system changes, reporting on experiences such as food change labs and local food councils. The section also looks at the inclusion of forcibly displaced persons in urban food systems, and the role that urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) can play in different circumstances.\n- Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture\n[...]\n- Urban and Regional Food Systems Planning\n[...]\n- Governance\n[...]",
