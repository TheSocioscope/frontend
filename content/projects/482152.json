  "description": "Arroz Reserva de la Hacienda focuses on enhancing the rice production of the Ibagué plateau through the establishment of a designation of origin for its high-quality rice. The project aims to add value to their product by industrializing rice processing and marketing it directly to consumers. Collaborating with the Serbe Arroz cooperative, it has been instrumental in promoting the rice's quality to consumers and in implementing modern agricultural practices, through a platform called Amtec, which focuses on the mass adoption of technology among farmers to increase efficiency and reduce costs.",
