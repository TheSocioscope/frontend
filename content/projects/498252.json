  "description": "The Dosojin project focuses on producing and distributing high-quality, organic Peruvian tea. The project emphasizes the use of 100% natural ingredients without additives, offering a product that is both artisanal and beneficial for health, including anti-cancer properties and digestive support. The company aims to educate consumers about the value of Peruvian tea, which has historical significance and is often misunderstood in the market. They differentiate themselves from competitors by providing a product that is free from microplastics and chemical additives, using a higher quantity of tea leaves for a more subtle flavor profile. The tea is sourced from reliable suppliers in Cusco and Arequipa, ensuring quality and sustainability through organic farming practices.",
