  "description": "Bio, founded in 2005-2006, aims to transform local corn production into bioethanol, enhancing value at the source. The plant in Río Cuarto began operations in 2012, producing 83,000 cubic meters of bioethanol annually, which has since expanded to 140,000 cubic meters. Bio also produces biodiesel and co-products like burlanda, which is used in animal feed. The company has developed multiple business units, including biogas production and carbon footprint measurement services, emphasizing sustainability and circular economy principles. Bio's growth has fostered regional economic development and partnerships with local producers and universities.",
