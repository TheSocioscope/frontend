  "description": "NI – Nutritional Intelligence is a project developed in partnership with the University of Rome ‘La Sapienza’, with Giomi Group/Gioservice and the Cristo Re Hospital in Rome. The entire production chain of the hospital has been rethought based on the application of food processing techniques implemented by Niko Romito at Ristorante Reale.  Thanks to this approach, not only the chemical – physical characteristics of the food served are improved but also the nutritional values of the after-cooked food. The project was implemented respecting the budget agreed upon. From the studies made on NI, two scientific articles were published proving the validity of the method developed.
