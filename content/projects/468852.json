  "description": "The Cacao Bosques y Paz initiative aims to promote sustainable cocoa production in Colombia, particularly in the Colombian Amazon, as part of the post-conflict strategy following the peace agreement with the FARC. The initiative emerged from concerns about the economic model that would be implemented in regions affected by the peace agreement, which are also critical for environmental conservation.\nThe initiative focuses on three main objectives: closing the agricultural frontier to prevent further deforestation, promoting agroforestry arrangements for cocoa cultivation, and generating sustainable income for local communities. Unlike cocoa production in West Africa, which is often linked to deforestation, Colombian cocoa is traditionally grown in agroforestry systems, making it a viable alternative for sustainable development. Overall, the Cacao Bosques y Paz initiative seeks to create a sustainable cocoa industry in Colombia that benefits local communities while preserving the environment, positioning Colombia as a model for sustainable cocoa production globally.",
