  "description": "\"Madre Terra\" is a certified organic farm that produces different types of vegetables according to the season. It has organic pest control methods and pays great attention to the biodiversity of insects and birds. 'Madre Terra' is particularly appreciated for its production of radicchio and the revival of the hedge technique to accommodate organisms useful for biological control. It also collaborates with solidarity purchasing groups (GAS) in the Veneto region, produces its own seeds independently and sells its vegetables through an independent outlet outside the large-scale retail trade. The founder Andrea Giubilato is an esteemed farmer, co-founder of the Itinerant Experiential School in Organic Farming, and a long-standing expert and proponent of organic farming methods in the region.
