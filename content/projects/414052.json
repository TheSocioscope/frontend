  "description": "Among the belligerents, Japanese authorities most systematically studied home front tactics--including food provision--during the two world wars.  Indeed, it is remarkable how long their methods in the Second World War kept the island nation fed in the face of formidable shortages.  Nonetheless, transnational learning about food security has its limits, and no two situations are identical. The Japanese might carefully study Germany’s food crisis in 1914-16 or British rationing in 1939, but it was Japan's misfortune to suffer an onslaught on popular nourishment by Allied submarines, mines, and aircraft on a scale the world had never seen.  No people can wage total war on empty stomachs, regardless of the regime’s efforts at \"spiritual mobilization.\"  Unlike Adolf Hitler, Japanese leaders did surrender before their homeland was invaded.  And hunger on the home front was a key reason for doing so.",
