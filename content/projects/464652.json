  "description": "Restaurant Nogen, a unique dining initiative in Denmark, operates on a model that exclusively utilizes food waste as its primary ingredient source. Established in 2022, it has rapidly expanded from one to four locations, offering a dynamic menu that changes daily based on available food waste. This innovative approach not only reduces waste but also fosters creativity among chefs, making it a compelling example of sustainable dining in the modern culinary landscape.
