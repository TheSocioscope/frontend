  "description": "Eco Brasas focuses on producing eco-friendly charcoal from coconut shells, transforming waste materials into a sustainable product. It began as a project inspired by a science fair and has evolved into a business that emphasizes environmental responsibility and efficiency. The entrepreneur behind this initiative has developed a unique briquette design that enhances airflow for better combustion, making it more efficient than traditional charcoal. The production process not only reduces waste but also aims to minimize the environmental impact associated with charcoal production. The initiative has garnered support from local organizations and aims to expand its market reach while maintaining a commitment to sustainability and innovation.",
