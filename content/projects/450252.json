The cooperative, Suriendo Redes y Sabores, focuses on promoting local, chemical-free, and farmer-based food alternatives. By connecting with various agroecological organizations, Madre Tierra facilitates direct producer-consumer markets, fostering community engagement and access to healthy food while supporting sustainable agricultural practices.",
