  "description": "Épices et Traditions is a small business specializing in the sale of organic spices, founded in 2018. Located in Rabat, it stands out for its made-to-order production model, guaranteeing product freshness. The company sources exclusively from family farms, notably those of cousins, who supply the raw materials. In addition to its online presence, the initiative participates in solidarity markets, reinforcing its local roots. Currently under construction, a physical store is scheduled to open soon in an upscale neighborhood, targeting a customer base concerned with product quality and origin.",
