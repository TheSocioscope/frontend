  "description": "Café Monteverde focuses on sustainable coffee production and community engagement. Originating in the late 1980s, it transitioned from dairy to coffee, emphasizing vertical integration to enhance profitability. By processing, roasting, and marketing their coffee directly, they add value at multiple stages. The initiative prioritizes ethical practices, ensuring fair treatment of workers and environmental stewardship. It also promotes ecotourism, offering educational experiences and tours. The organization actively supports local farmers and invests in community development, reflecting a commitment to both quality coffee and social responsibility.",
