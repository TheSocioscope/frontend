  "description": "Chacra Mil is an initiative aimed at connecting with Andean farming communities through experimental farmland. Established in 2017, it serves as a platform for testing the efficiency of various Andean cultivars, focusing on recovering potentially endangered crops. The project not only enhances local diets with nutritionally dense products but also fosters community engagement and agricultural innovation, addressing challenges like climate change and water scarcity while promoting agrobiodiversity and cultural identity.",
