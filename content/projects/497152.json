  "description": "The Nuwa Muun project, meaning \"great woman\" in the Oajún dialect, aims to empower women cocoa farmers in the Junín and Pasco regions of Peru. Spearheaded by Machu Picchu Foods, it focuses on enhancing productivity through organic farming practices and technical support. The initiative supports 25 women, primarily single heads of households, by providing training, organic fertilizers, and tools, ultimately fostering economic independence and community resilience among these producers. It emphasizes the importance of community, technical support, and the development of skills, fostering a sense of belonging and agency among the women involved. ",
