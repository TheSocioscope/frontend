  "description": "Foodsavers in Ghent collects food surpluses via a logistics platform and delivers them to social organisations in Ghent.\nWith Foodsavers, the City of Ghent is tackling the ‘food waste’ problem on a large scale. More than 1,000 tonnes of food surpluses from supermarkets or auctions have already been redistributed through poverty alleviation organisations and social restaurants. In this way, we save on CO2 emissions, employ people who are long-term unemployed and fight poverty.  The Foodsavers project originated from a bottom-up idea, which was picked up and developed further by the City.",
