Founded in La Rochelle, the initiative redistributes the collected fruits to charities and local organizations, fostering community ties and preserving local heritage. The project operates primarily through volunteer efforts, emphasizing a spontaneous and organic approach to connecting with both fruit owners and beneficiaries.     ",
