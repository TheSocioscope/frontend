  "description": "Rasoterra is a restaurant initiative founded in 2013, evolving from previous experiences in the food industry. The motivation behind Rasoterra was to address the lack of sustainability-focused dining options in Barcelona, particularly within the vegetarian and vegan scenes, which were not as developed at the time. The restaurant operates on three core pillars: microfiltered water, sourcing from local producers, and promoting vegetarianism, with a strong emphasis on sustainability. The restaurant prioritizes working with local producers who share their values, engaging in dialogue about what to plant and how to cultivate crops sustainably. They focus on seasonal ingredients and aim to minimize their ecological footprint by composting organic waste and reducing plastic use.",
