  "description": "The initiative focuses on transforming cocoa into various products while promoting ecotourism in a rural area. It began with local farmers seeking sustainable crops after facing challenges with previous ventures. The project not only cultivates cocoa but also educates visitors about the entire production process, enhancing community engagement. By integrating tourism, the initiative aims to create economic opportunities and reduce reliance on illicit crops. It emphasizes the importance of networking and collaboration with local organizations to strengthen its business model and expand its reach in the market.",
