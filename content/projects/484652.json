  "description": "The FORGENT initiative, also known as Le Fourgon, is a French company focused on reusing packaging, specifically glass jars, for delivering groceries and personal care products. Their goal is to eliminate plastic waste by providing a sustainable online supermarket experience. Customers receive their orders in reusable glass containers, which are later collected, cleaned, and reused. Founded in 2021, Le Fourgon has quickly become a leader in the reuse sector in France, emphasizing environmental responsibility and customer engagement.",
