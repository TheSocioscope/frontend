  "description": "The initiative in Ungersheim focuses on sustainable agriculture and food sovereignty. Over eight years, the project has evolved from a single market gardener to a collaborative team, emphasizing local food production, energy independence, and community engagement. The farm not only supplies the local canteen but also distributes free vegetable baskets to households, fostering awareness of organic farming. This innovative model aims to educate and empower the community while promoting ecological practices.",
