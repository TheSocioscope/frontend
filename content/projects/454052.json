  "description": "Eat Wasted focuses on addressing food waste and food insecurity by transforming discarded bread into pasta. Inspired by personal histories and a commitment to sustainability, it aims to create a community around shared meals and meaningful connections. The project began with small-scale dinners to test the product and foster community engagement. As interest grew, the initiative expanded its reach, collaborating with local bakeries and chefs to refine its offerings. Ultimately, it seeks to scale production while maintaining its mission of reducing waste and nurturing those in need.",
