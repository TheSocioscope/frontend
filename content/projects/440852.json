  "description": "Alpina focuses on sustainability efforts within a prominent Colombian dairy company, which has been a market leader for over 70 years. The sustainability team, driven by the company's ownership values, aims to implement practices that exceed local regulations and promote environmental responsibility across their operations. This includes initiatives such as reducing plastic use, improving water management, and providing technical assistance to dairy farmers to enhance milk production efficiency while minimizing environmental impact. The company is committed to integrating sustainability into its business model, viewing it as essential for long-term survival rather than merely a marketing strategy. The initiative also emphasizes collaboration with suppliers and stakeholders to foster a broader impact on the industry and community.",
