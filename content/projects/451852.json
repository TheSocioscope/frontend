  "description": "The initiative focuses on producing active ingredients, such as mycosporins, which have antioxidant properties and potential applications in both cosmetics and the food industry. This approach addresses global demands for safer, environmentally friendly products. The team has faced challenges in merging scientific research with private sector needs, but they have successfully navigated these through partnerships and external advice. Their goal is to create a diverse range of products that leverage Patagonia's unique genetic resources while fostering a sustainable biotechnology platform.",
