  "description": "Dehytech East Africa focuses on distributing solar food dehydrators. The primary goal of the initiative is to reduce post-harvest losses, which can average around 30% due to inadequate storage and preservation methods. By providing farmers with affordable and effective solar dehydrators, Dehytech aims to enhance food safety and security, allowing farmers to preserve a variety of food products, including fruits, vegetables, and meats. Dehytech collaborates with various organizations, cooperatives, and individual farmers, particularly in regions like Kenya, to implement this technology. They also offer training and support to ensure that users can effectively utilize the dehydrators. ",
