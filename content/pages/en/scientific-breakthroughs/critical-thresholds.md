# Critical Thresholds

Identifying the tipping points where individual initiatives become systemic transformation.

## The Nature of Tipping Points

Change doesn't happen gradually and linearly. Instead, systems often remain stable until reaching a critical threshold, after which rapid transformation occurs.

## Identifying Thresholds

Our research is revealing:
- **Network density thresholds**: When enough connections form, information flows freely
- **Cultural tipping points**: When new practices become normalized
- **Economic viability thresholds**: When alternatives become competitive
- **Political momentum**: When movements gain enough support for policy change

## Strategic Implications

Understanding thresholds helps change-makers focus their efforts on reaching critical mass rather than trying to change everything at once.
