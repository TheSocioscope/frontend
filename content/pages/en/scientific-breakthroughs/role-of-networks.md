# The Role of Networks

How connections between people and organizations create the conditions for change to spread.

## Network Architecture Matters

Our analysis shows that the structure of networks—who is connected to whom—is often more important than the resources available or the number of participants.

## Key Network Patterns

- **Bridge builders**: Individuals who connect otherwise separate groups
- **Dense clusters**: Strong local connections that enable coordination
- **Weak ties**: Loose connections that spread information and innovation
- **Redundancy**: Multiple pathways that make networks resilient

## From Networks to Movements

Understanding network dynamics helps explain how local initiatives can grow into broader movements for change.
