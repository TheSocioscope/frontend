# Mechanisms of Scaling

Understanding how local innovations spread and adapt across different contexts.

## Beyond Simple Replication

Successful scaling isn't about copying what works in one place and pasting it elsewhere. Instead, it requires:

- **Adaptation**: Modifying approaches to fit local context
- **Translation**: Expressing core principles in culturally relevant ways
- **Integration**: Building on existing practices rather than replacing them
- **Co-creation**: Involving new communities in shaping solutions

## Patterns of Diffusion

Our research identifies several ways innovations spread:
- **Peer-to-peer learning**: Direct exchange between practitioners
- **Network effects**: Value increases as more people participate
- **Policy support**: Institutional backing that enables expansion
- **Market mechanisms**: Economic incentives that drive adoption

## Maintaining Integrity While Adapting

The key challenge is preserving what makes an innovation effective while adapting it to new contexts.
